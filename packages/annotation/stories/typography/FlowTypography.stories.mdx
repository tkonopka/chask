# FlowTypography

export const Template = args => <FlowTypography {...args} />

`FlowTypography` animates text so that it reveals one character at a time.

<ArgsTable of={FlowTypography} />

## Reveal rate

The speed of text reveal is determined by props `rate` and `duration`.
Prop `rate` sets the number of characters that appear per second.
Prop `duration`, which overrides `rate`, sets the total length of time for the animation.

The two examples below display 'This is an example' using default settings (left)
and with custom `rate` to slow down the effect (right).
Click on the button to start the animation.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="default">
        <FlowTypographyDemo style={{ textAnchor: 'start', fontSize: '18px' }}>
            This is an example.
        </FlowTypographyDemo>
    </Story>
    <Story name="slow text">
        <FlowTypographyDemo rate={2} style={{ textAnchor: 'start', fontSize: '18px' }}>
            This is an example.
        </FlowTypographyDemo>
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Styling

Text can be styled using css, including with filters.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="styled">
        <FlowTypographyDemo
            style={{ textAnchor: 'start', fontSize: '18px', fill: '#ffffff', filter: 'url(#bg)' }}
        >
            This is an example.
        </FlowTypographyDemo>
    </Story>
</Canvas>
