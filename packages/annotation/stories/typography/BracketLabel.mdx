# BracketLabel

`BracketLabel` displays a bracket and a text label. A 'bracket' is a line that forms a shape like '\[' or ']'.

<ArgTypes of={BracketLabelStories} />

## Ticks

The feature that distinguishes `BracketLabel` from `LineLabel` is the presence of ticks at the ends of the line.
The length of these ticks is determined by prop `tickSize`.

<Canvas of={BracketLabelStories.LongTicks} />

## Other settings

`BracketLabel` shares many props and features with `LineLabel`, for example with regard to orientation of text, rotations, and styling.
See documentation for `LineLabel` for details.
