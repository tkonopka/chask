# HistogramArea

<Meta of={HistogramAreaStories} />

`HistogramArea` paints polygons that represent histograms.

<ArgTypes of={HistogramAreaStories} />

## Curves

All histograms are computed from a binned representation of data.
Prop `curve` controls the type of interpolation between bins.

The curve settings that are most appropriate for histograms are 'MonotoneX' and 'Step'.
These interpolations guarantee that the the outline will remain above the baseline.
The `Step` curve type conveys the binning strategy.

## Multiple series

Use `HistogramArea` multiple times to overlay multiple series.
Each series can have a distinct curve setting and css style.
