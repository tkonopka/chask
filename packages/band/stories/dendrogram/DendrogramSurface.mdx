# DendrogramSurface

<Meta of={DendrogramSurfaceStories} />

`DendrogramSurface` draws rectangles around dendrogram branches.

<ArgTypes of={DendrogramSurfaceStories} />

## Data subsets

By default `DendrogramSurface` draws a series of rectangles, each capturing one layer of the dendrogram's hierarchy.

<Canvas of={DendrogramSurfaceStories.AllLevels} />

Prop `levels` accepts an array of integers that denote specific parts of the dendrogram.
Integers are interpreted as indexes in the `merge` field in the original data.

<Canvas of={DendrogramSurfaceStories.SelectedLevels} />

Prop `ids` uses a list of leaf identifiers to creates a surface around the branch that encompasses those leaves.

<Canvas of={DendrogramSurfaceStories.Subset} />

A distinction between `levels` and `ids` is that an array of `ids` always creates only a single surface.
In contrast, an array of `levels` draws multiple surfaces.

## Expansion

Prop `expansion` enlarges the surface around a branch.

<Canvas of={DendrogramSurfaceStories.Expansion} />

## Interactivity

Prop `interactive` toggles interactivity, which makes surfaces become visible only upon mouse interactions.

<Canvas of={DendrogramSurfaceStories.Interactivity} />

Note that if `DendrogramTree` (or any other component) is layered on top of `DendrogramSurface`,
it may be desirable to turn off pointer events on the top layer.
This is achieved by including `pointerEvents: 'none'` in the top layer's style.
