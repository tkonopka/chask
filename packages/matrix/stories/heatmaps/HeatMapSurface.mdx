<ArgTypes of={HeatMapSurfaceStories} />

## Expansions

`HeatMapSurface` draws a rectangle with corners at the centers of heat map cells.
To expand the rectangle to capture the entire cells, use prop `expansion` and provide values as multiples of cell width/height.

<Canvas of={HeatMapSurfaceStories.Default} />
<Canvas of={HeatMapSurfaceStories.Expanded} />

## Data subsets

Providing values to props `ids` and `keys` makes the surface cover only a part of the heatmap.
