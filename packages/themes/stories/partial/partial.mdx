# Partial themes

Partial themes are objects that satisfy typescript type `ThemeSpec` from `@chsk/core`.
These objects can be passed to the `theme` prop of a `Chart` component.
They can also be extended and augmented using `mergeTheme` and `mergeThemes` utilities.

The sections below showcase partial themes in `@chsk/themes`.
For simplicity of presentation, these sections are named after the theme objects and are arranged alphabetically.

## `boxedViewTheme`

The boxed theme is characterized by axes that are offset slightly from the edges of the view.
`Surface` components create a bounding box around a view.

<Story of={PartialStories.BoxedView} />

## `faintTicksTheme`

`faintTicksTheme` sets colors and line widths to de-emphasize ticks on the axes.

<Story of={PartialStories.FaintTicks} />

## `fontSystemUITheme`

`fontSystemUITheme` changes the default font style to 'system-ui'.

<Story of={PartialStories.FontSystemUi} />

## `inverseGridTheme`

The inverse grid theme is characterized by white grid lines.

<Story of={PartialStories.InverseGrid} />

## `smallAxisTextTheme`

`smallAxisTextTheme` sets the font size for axis labels and axis ticks to '10px'

<Story of={PartialStories.SmallAxisText} />
