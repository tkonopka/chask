# Path

<Meta of={PathStories} />

`Path` displays a (curved) line.

<ArgTypes of={PathStories} />

## Open curves

Paths are defined by a series of points, and interpolations are controlled via the prop `curve`. The examples below show distinct curves produced by the same set of points.

<Canvas of={PathStories.Linear} />
<Canvas of={PathStories.Natural} />
<Canvas of={PathStories.MonotoneX} />
<Canvas of={PathStories.Step} />

## Closed curves

Paths can display closed curves.

<Canvas of={PathStories.LinearClosed} />
<Canvas of={PathStories.BasisClosed} />
<Canvas of={PathStories.CardinalClosed} />
<Canvas of={PathStories.CatmullRomClosed} />

## Style

Paths can be styled with css.
In particular, paths may require setting the `fill` or `fillOpacity` attributes.

<Canvas of={PathStories.OpenFilled} />
<Canvas of={PathStories.ClosedFilled} />
