# FlowPath

`FlowPath` creates an animated path.

<ArgTypes of={FlowPathStories} />

## Trajectory

The trajectory of `FlowPath` is determined by a series of points specified in prop `points`.
There can be as few as two points to create a single line segment, or many points to create a complex path.

Click the milestone buttons in the examples below to see the animation.

<Canvas of={FlowPathStories.SimpleLine} />
<Canvas of={FlowPathStories.ComplexLine} />

Note that for the animation to show-up correctly, the `fill-opacity` css attribute should be set to 0 for the path.
This can be achieved via themes, or by providing a `style` prop.

## Curves

By default, `FlowPath` connects points with straight, i.e. linear, segments.
Other interpolations between points can be set with prop `curve`.

<Canvas of={FlowPathStories.NaturalCurve} />

## Transitions

The duration of the animation (and other animation settings) can be adjusted via prop `transition`.

<Canvas of={FlowPathStories.SlowTransition} />

## Styling

Paths can be styled using css.
Note, however, that the animation (managed by framer-motion) utilises property `strokeDasharray`, and this property should not be modified with custom settings.
