# Axis

<Meta of={AxisLineStories} />

`AxisLine` draws a line intended as an axis.
It is intended to be used a child of an `Axis` component.

<ArgTypes of={AxisLineStories} />

## Variants

Prop `variant` configures a line for the top, right, bottom, or left side of a chart.
For brevity, the example below shows a line along the bottom edge.

<Canvas of={AxisLineStories.Visibility} />

Note that in the default theme, the axis line has zero thickness and is therefore invisible.
To make the line appear, set a css style, or adjust the chart theme.
