# HeatMapCircle

<Meta of={HeatMapCircleStories} />

`HeatMapCircle` draws a single circle.

<ArgTypes of={HeatMapCircle} />

## Example

`HeatMapCircle` is closely related to `HeatMapSimpleCircle`.
It is intended to be used in `HeatMapCells` to draw a heat map with custom cells.

<Canvas of={HeatMapCircleStories.Example} />

In contrast to `HeatMapSimpleCircle`, `HeatMapCircle` provides animation for the color fill and the radius.
These animations can make heatmap updates appear smoother.
However, in large visualizations with hundreds of cells, animations may decrease responsiveness.
