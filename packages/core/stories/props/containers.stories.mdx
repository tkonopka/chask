# Containers

Container props define a rectangular region inside an existing container, view, or chart.

<ArgsTable of={MockContainer} />

These props may appear in the API of a component, as in `Label`.
Alternatively, they may be grouped into a single `container` prop, as in `View`.
Either way, they always carry the same meaning.

### Position

`position` is a two-element array that specifies [x, y] coordinates for the container.
The exact meaning of these coordinates is dependent on prop `anchor` (see below), but
default settings typically set these coordinates as the top-left corner of a rectangle.

The position coordinates can be specified in absolute svg units, as fractions of an existing/parent container,
or using view-specific coordinates. These modes are toggled with prop `positionUnits`, taking values as 'absolute',
'relative', and 'view', respectively.

### Size

`size` is a two-element array that specifies the [width, height] of the container region.

Values can be specified in absolute svg units, as fractions of an existing/parent container,
or using view-specific coordinates. These modes are toggled with prop `sizeUnits`.

### Anchor

`anchor` is a two-element array that determines the interpretation of the `position`.

As an example, an anchor of `[0.5, 0.5]` means that the center of a container rectangle will be
located at `position`. An anchor of `[0, 0]` means that the position is the top-left corner of the rectangle.

### Padding

`padding` is a four-element array that determines space along the top, right, bottom, and left
boundaries of the container, in that order. Padding always uses absolute svg values.

### Offset

`offset` is a two-element array that always uses absolute svg coordinates.
It translates the container by a fixed amount.
The translation is always applied as a final step in container placement,
i.e. after calculations determined by `position`, `size`, `padding`, and `anchor`.
