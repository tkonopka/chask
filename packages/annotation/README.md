# @chsk/annotation

`@chsk/annotation` is part of a data visualization framework based on

incorporated into any chart type.

## Features

    regions

    provide explanations for specific chart elements
-   **Markers** use svg capabilities to display lines with custom symbols
    such as arrowheads
-   **Symbols** provide a library of shapes for use as standalone elements,
    points in scatter charts, or in legends
-   **Export utilities** save charts to svg files, optimizing content to
    achieve small file sizes
