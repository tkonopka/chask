# UpSetBar

<Meta of={UpSetBarStories} />

`UpSetBar` sets up a sub-view within an `UpSet` view.
The sub-view is set up to display a bar chart displaying set intersection sizes.

<ArgTypes of={UpSetBarStories} />

Note that the `UpSetBar` component does not draw any visible elements;
it only pre-processes data so that it can be visualized with other components, notably `Bars` from the `@chsk/band` package.
Moreover, `UpSetBar` only performs its function within a view set up by `UpSet`.
Putting these two elements together, it is quite difficult to demonstrate `UpSetBar` apart from other components.
As a result, examples on this page show near-complete upset charts that combine multiple elements.

## Orientation

The `UpSet` chart can be oriented horizontally or vertically, and the `UpSetBar` component automatically prepares the bar sub-chart accordingly.
On a horizontal upset chart, the bar sub-chart is positioned above the grid.
On a vertical upset chart, the bar sub-chart is placed to the right of the grid.

<Canvas of={UpSetBarStories.Horizontal} />
<Canvas of={UpSetBarStories.Vertical} />

Note that in order for the chart as a whole to have space for the bars, the parent `UpSet` view should have appropriate padding.
