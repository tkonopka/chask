# Scatter

<Meta of={ScatterStories} />

`Scatter` sets up a view for a scatter plot.

`Scatter` is an organizational component and it does not actually draw any visual elements.
However, it manages data representations that can be visualized with other components, for example `ScatterPoints` or `ScatterCurve`.

<ArgTypes of={ScatterStories} />

## Data

Data should be prepared as an array of objects.
All objects should contain a string identifier `'id'` and an object called `data` that itself consists of an array of records.
The records in the `data` array will constitute the individual data points for plotting.

The pseudocode below demonstrates the required format.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "data": [
     {
       "a": 1,
       "b": 2,
       "c": 3
     },
     {
       "a": 2,
       "b": 4,
       "c": 6
     }
   ]
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

The above dataset has a series identifier `alpha`.
Points associated with this id will be drawn in the same color.
The nested data array consists of two records with three keys each (`a`, `b`, and `c`).
These keys can be used to extract values for x- and y-axes.

## Axis scaling

`Scatter` can set up x- and y-axes according to manual specifications, or determine relevant settings based on data.
To demonstrate this, the examples below use `Scatter` (which doesn't create any visual elements) together with components that visualize axes and an example dataset.

When the scales on the axes are determined automatically, `Scatter` automatically adjusts the scales when the data changes, for example when certain data series are toggled via a legend (below, left).
The automatic rescaling can be disabled via prop `autoRescale` (below, right).

## Symbol size

By default, `Scatter` assumes all data points should have equal size.
The base size is determined by prop `valueSize`.

<Canvas of={ScatterStories.BaseSymbolSize} />

To apply different symbol sizes to each point, set `valueSize` to a string key that carries a size value in the original data.
Each point's size value is used together with the chart's size scale, specified with prop `scaleSize`.

<Canvas of={ScatterStories.BubbleSize} />

Note that size is interpreted as a quantity that is proportional to the area of a symbol.
To visualize the size scale, see `LegendSizeScale`.

## Symbol color

By default, symbol colors are determined automatically using a categorical color scheme.
Thus, colors are determined by the data series (see examples above).
The color scheme can be adjusted using prop `scaleColor` - use a categorical scale variant.

It is possible to apply colors to individual points by setting prop `valueColor`.
Values extracted with `valueColor` will be transformed into colors using a color scale specified via prop `scaleColor` - use a sequential or diverging scale variant.
The example below shows points in shades of red.

<Canvas of={ScatterStories.BubbleColor} />

The data in the example above are the same as in the bubble size example.
Thus, large bubbles in the earlier examples appear as dark dots above.
To visualize the color scale, see `LegendColorScale`.

## Clipping

To restrict view content to the intended dimensions, use a `ViewClip` component.

The two examples below demonstrate the effects of clipping.
(Use the toolbar to zoom in and out.)
The first example does not use clipping, and the data points can appear beyond the axes upon zoom.
The second example uses clipping, and the data are always constrained.
