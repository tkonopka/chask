# LinearGradient

<Meta of={LinearGradientStories} />

`LinearGradient` is a component that defines a color gradient.
Definitions are invisible themselves, but they can be used to decorate other components.
In particular, color gradients are used to create color legends.

## Two-color gradients

The simplest gradients define just two colors with prop `stops`.

## Custom colors, offsets, directions

Props `stops` and `offsets` can be used to define complex gradients with multiple colors and spacings between colors.
Props `start` and `end` can be used to set the direction for the color progression.
