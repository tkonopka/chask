# UpSetMemberships

<Meta of={UpSetMembershipsStories} />

`UpSetMemberships` summarizes set intersections through a graphical system of symbols and connecting lines.
The graphical scheme is motivated and explained by the creators of UpSet charts [here](https://upset.app/).

## Set memberships

`UpSetMemberships` displays symbols and lines to mark set intersections.
In the examples below, the dataset consists of four sets labeled 'alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', and 'delta'.

The interpretation of these visual elements follows the conventions of [upset charts](https://upset.app/).
Isolated symbols convey that a set contains elements that are not shared with any other set.
When two or more symbols are connected with a line, the line indicates that some elements are present in all the marked sets, but not in any of the unmarked sets.

Note that `UpSetMemberships` does not draw a background grid.
A grid can be added separately using `UpSetGrid`.

## Custom symbols

The default set markers is a circle.
That can be replaced by a custom symbol using prop `symbol`.

## Styling

Symbols and lines can be styled using props `symbolStyle` and `lineStyle`, respectively.
