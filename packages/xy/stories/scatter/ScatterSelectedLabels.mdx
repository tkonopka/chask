# ScatterSelectedLabels

<Meta of={ScatterSelectedLabelsStories} />

`ScatterSelectedLabels` draws a set of labels on a scatter plot, automatically adjusting their positions to avoid overlaps.

<ArgTypes of={ScatterSelectedLabelsStories} />

## Data

`ScatterSelectedLabels` requires a data object specifying the data points to label.
This object should be an array, with each element holding an `id` of the data series,
an `index` specifying the data point in the series, a `size` array to set the
dimensions for the label, and a `content` field.

The pseudocode below demonstrates the required format.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "index": 0,
   "size": [60, 25],
   "content": "label content"
   },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

## Label position

The position of each label is determined automatically.
By default, a label appear directly above a data point.
If placing a label above a data point would interfere with existing data points,
the labels may shift slightly, as in the second example below.

<Canvas of={ScatterSelectedLabelsStories.TwoB} />

## Offset

Prop `offset` determines an initial shift of the label from its associated data point.
This prop can determine if a label is pushed above, below, or to the side of the data.

Note that values in this prop should be small.
The values are only meant to orient the initial direction of label displacement;
after the initial displacement, much of the label adjustments are determined by prop `clearance` (see below).

## Clearance

Prop `clearance` determines the space between a data point and its label.

Clearance calculations takes the size of each data point into account.
