# Using the documentation

The documentation is organized into three main parts.

Section **CORE** describes the `@chsk/core` package, which provides general-purpose infrastructure for data visualization. The section covers components, hooks, and props. Documentation pages summarize APIs and provide some illustrative examples.

Section **ADDONS** covers other packages of the `@chsk` ecosystem. These packages provide components for specific chart types, e.g. bar charts or scatter charts.

The **GALLERY** contains examples of visualizations that combine multiple components from the core and add-on packages. In some cases, the examples use the framework's infrastructure to create bespoke components.

### Note on interactivity

This documentation site is powered by [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and includes both text-based descriptions and interactive examples.

In the table of contents (on the left of the page), the text descriptions appear with the heading 'Docs'. Those pages often have a table summarizing a component's API, some illustrative examples, and descriptions that give context to the examples.

The examples also appear as separate entries in the table of contents. In those views, many of the examples provide interactive controls.
