# Button

<Meta of={ButtonStories} />

`Button` is a minimal click-able button component.

`Button` is not really intended to be used in practice.
Rather, it is a demonstration of an implementation of the `ButtonProps` interface.

<ArgTypes of={ButtonStories} />

## Variants

Prop `variant`, like in most library components, is used to annotated a component via a `role` attribute and
a css class. When a `Button` is created without any content, it is also used as a text label.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.TextButton} />

Note that the text element is click-able; here, click events generate output in the console.
(Click on the text, then check the console `Ctrl Shift J`.)

## Custom content

`Button` components can contain arbitrary content.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.CustomContent} />

The content of the button is clickable. (Click on the rectangle, then check the console `Ctrl Shift J`.)

## Styling

Styles supplied to `Button` are used to style the wrapping `g` element, not the button content.

## Other props

`Button` shares props with `Label`. See `Label` for further details.
