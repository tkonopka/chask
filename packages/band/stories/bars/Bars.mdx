# Bars

<Meta of={BarsStories} />

`Bars` draws a set of rectangles to display a bar chart.

`Bars` is intended to be used within a `Bar` view. The `Bars` component is the one that draws visual elements, but actually much of the layout is determined by `Bar`.

<ArgTypes of={BarsStories} />

## Data subsets

By default, `Bars` draws the entire dataset. To draw subsets of bars, set props `ids` and `keys`.

<Canvas of={BarsStories.SelectedIds} />
<Canvas of={BarsStories.SelectedKeys} />

## Mouse events

To make bars respond to mouse events, set prop `handlers`.

<Canvas of={BarsStories.MouseClick} />

(Check the browser console with `Ctrl Shift J` for output.)

## Style modifiers

Prop `modifiers` accepts specifications for css styles that are applied following mouse events.

<Canvas of={BarsStories.StyleModifiers} />

## Tooltip

By default, `Bars` automatically manages data for a tooltip.
To make a tooltip visible, include a `Tooltip` component beside `Bars`.

<Canvas of={BarsStories.WithTooltip} />

If a tooltip is not needed, having `Bars` manage tooltip data is unnecessary.
To remove tooltip management, set prop `dataComponent` to either `DataComponent` or `SimpleDataComponent` from `@chsk/core`.
