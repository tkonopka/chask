# ArrowMarker

<Meta of={ArrowMarkerStories} />

`ArrowMarker` creates a definition for an arrow-head 'marker'.
Markers are invisible themselves, but they can be used to decorate `Line` or `Path` components.

<ArgTypes of={ArrowMarkerStories} />

`ArrowMarker` objects should be contained within an svg `def` tag.

## Variants

Prop `variant` determines the shape of the arrowhead.

<Canvas of={ArrowMarkerStories.Triangle} />
<Canvas of={ArrowMarkerStories.Winged} />
<Canvas of={ArrowMarkerStories.Chevron} />

Note that for the arrow shapes to appear correctly, it may be necessary to set styles in the `ArrowMarker` component.
In particular, the `chevron` arrowhead requires `fillOpacity: 0`.

## Arrow size and width

The shape of the arrowheads can further be adjusted using props `size` and `width`.
The overall weight is also scaled by the stroke width of the line.

<Canvas of={ArrowMarkerStories.Narrow} />
<Canvas of={ArrowMarkerStories.Large} />
<Canvas of={ArrowMarkerStories.DoubleSided} />
