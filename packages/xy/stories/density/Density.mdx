# Density

<Meta of={DensityStories} />

`Density` sets up a view for a density plot.

<ArgTypes of={DensityStories} />

## Data

Data should be prepared as an array of objects. The format is equivalent as for the `Scatter` view.

## Bin size

`Density` assigns data points into bins. The size of the bins, measured in pixels / svg coordinates,
determines the resolution of the density map.

## Color

By default, `Density` assigns colors using a categorical scale based on series id (analogously as in `Scatter`).
To use color values encoded in the dataset, specify `valueColor` to indicate how to extract color values from the data,
and set a custom `scaleColor` to define a color scale.
