# Draggable

<Meta of={DraggableStories} />

`Draggable` is a wrapper that enables dragging element.

<ArgTypes of={DraggableStories} />

## Variants

The default variant allows unconstrained dragging.

<Canvas of={DraggableStories.XY} />

Variants `x` and `y` constrain motion along the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively.

<Canvas of={DraggableStories.X} />
<Canvas of={DraggableStories.Y} />

## Position

`Draggable` accepts a props `position` and `positionUnits` to associate coordinates with the draggable element.
These props are used for internal book-keeping and do not affect the rendering of the draggable element.
In some use-cases, therefore, it is not necessary to set these props.
The props are relevant, however, for extracting information about changes in the draggable element through even handlers (see below).

## Events

Handlers `onDragStart`, `onDrag`, and `onDragEnd` accept functions that can process information during the drag process.
Specifically, the first argument passed to these functions has information about the drag state.

In the examples below, a custom `onDrag` handler parses information about the drag state and updates the chart title.
The custom handler also logs the entire drag state (check the browser console with `Ctrl Shift J`).

<Canvas of={DraggableStories.Linear} />
<Canvas of={DraggableStories.Band} />

Note that in the case of band scales, the information returned may need some post-processing.
Transforming a continuous position along the axis to a discrete band is ambiguous, and thus resolving that
ambiguity is left for application-specific code.

## Expansion

Prop `expansion` helps to set the size of a surrounding region used to catch mouse events.
The default region comprises a current view, plus a comfortable surrounding area.
In most practical situations, it is not necessary to change this default.

## Timeout

Prop `timeout` sets a time interval between a mouse down event and the moment when the draggable element is fully committed to dragging.
This timeout is relevant when children have event handlers.
A nonzero timeout allows those children to receive and process click events.
After the timeout, `Draggable` creates an invisible layer on top the chart that prevents events on lower layers.
These properties make it possible to create, for example, legends that are both clickable and draggable.
