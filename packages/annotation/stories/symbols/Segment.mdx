# Segment

`Segment` displays a short horizontal line segment. It is intended as a symbol for legends.

<ArgTypes of={SegmentStories} />

## Legends

`Segment` accepts the same props as symbols like `Circle`, `Square`, and others.
The component can thus be used as a symbol in a legend. It can also be styled using css.

<Canvas of={SegmentStories.InLegend} />
<Canvas of={SegmentStories.Styled} />
