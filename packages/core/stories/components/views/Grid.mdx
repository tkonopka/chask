# Grid

<Meta of={GridStories} />

`Grid` is an organizational component.
It does not display any visual elements, but it conceptually splits the available chart space into a grid.
Children components can access this grid to position their content.

<ArgTypes of={GridStories} />

## Rows and columns

Prop `grid` accepts an array with integers representing the number of columns and rows in the grid.

The example below creates a 3x3 grid, and populates the cells with content to visualize the layout.

<Canvas of={GridStories.GridSize} />

## Variants

Prop `variant` toggles between horizontal and vertical arrangements of cells within the grid.
The default layout is `horizontal`, in which the cells are arranged from left-to right, then down a row, and so on
(see examples above).
The alternative variant is `vertical`, in which the cells are arranged going downward, then across.

<Canvas of={GridStories.Vertical} />

## Spacing

Prop `spacing` accepts an array with horizontal and vertical distances between columns and rows, respectively.

<Canvas of={GridStories.Spacing} />

## Custom item dimensions

Props `widths` and `heights` tune the relative sizes of the columns and rows, respectively.

<Canvas of={GridStories.CustomWidths} />
<Canvas of={GridStories.CustomHeights} />
