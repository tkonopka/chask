# SimpleDataComponent

<Meta of={SimpleDataComponentStories} />

`SimpleDataComponent` creates a new object / component.

`SimpleDataComponent` is a trivial wrapper for `createReactElement`.
Its main use-case is to serve as a drop-in replacement for `DataComponent`.
Whereas `DataComponent` binds handlers to take actions in response to mouse events, `SimpleDataComponent` omits those book-keeping steps.

The simpler implementation of `SimpleDataComponent` can offer a small performance boost in situations where event handling is not necessary.
