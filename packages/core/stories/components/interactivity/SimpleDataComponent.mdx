# SimpleDataComponent

<Meta of={SimpleDataComponentStories} />

`SimpleDataComponent` creates a new object / component.

`SimpleDataComponent` is a trivial wrapper for `createReactElement`.
Its main use-case is to serve as a drop-in replacement for `DataComponent`.
Whereas `DataComponent` binds handlers to take actions in response to mouse events, `SimpleDataComponent` omits those book-keeping steps.
The simpler implementation offers a small performance boost in situations where event handling is not necessary.

<ArgTypes of={SimpleDataComponentStories} />

## Example

`SimpleDataComponent` takes a prop `component` to specify a drawing function,
and a prop `props` holding data passed to the drawing function.

<Canvas of={SimpleDataComponentStories.Example} />

The above example should display a simple circle.
To repeat the message above, `SimpleDataComponent` only uses its `component` to
create an element with the given props.

(Note that the code preview may not display the `component` prop.
That is an imperfection in the preview.
The prop `component` is required and should receive a function that creates a new React node.)
