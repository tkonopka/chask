# Axis

<Meta of={AxisStories} />

`Axis` draws an axis on a chart.

<ArgTypes of={AxisStories} />

## Variants

`Axis` is a composite component that draws a line, a label, and ticks marks with labels.
Predefined variants place these elements on the top, right, bottom, or left sides of a chart.

<Canvas of={AxisStories.Top} />
<Canvas of={AxisStories.Right} />
<Canvas of={AxisStories.Bottom} />
<Canvas of={AxisStories.Left} />

## Distance from boundary

By default, axes are positioned on the border of the charting surface. They can be moved with the prop `distance`.

<Canvas of={AxisStories.AxisPadding} />

## Longform syntax

Example above use a shorthand syntax, whereby the `Axis` component displays an axis line, an axis label, and ticks.
Because of this shorthand form, there are a limited tuning props.

For more fine-grained control, `Axis` can instead be used as a container
with `AxisLine`, `AxisLabel`, and `AxisTicks` as child components.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  <Axis variant={'top'}>
   <AxisLine />
   <AxisLabel>axis label</AxisLabel>
   <AxisTicks />
  </Axis>
  `}
/>

It is also possible to use any of the child components multiple times.
Below, the axis draws two sets of ticks of different sizes.
