# MilestoneMotion

<Meta title="Core/Components/Charts/MilestoneMotion" />
export const Template = args => <MilestoneMotion {...args} />

`MilestoneMotion` is an organizational component. It does not draw anything itself, but it controls when its children elements appear and disappear.

Charts keep track of a set of 'milestones', which can be toggled on and off, for example using buttons. `MilestoneMotion` components detect changes in the milestones and trigger the visibility of their children elements.

<ArgsTable of={MilestoneMotion} />

Note: examples on this page involve multiple components, including external buttons. For this reason, the code is more than a few lines long; the complete source code is available in the [source repository](https://github.com/tkonopka/chsk/blob/main/packages/core/stories/components/Milestone.animations.tsx).

## Entry milestones

Prop `initialOn` specifies the milestone at which a component should appear into view. Prop `initial` specifies the initial state of the entry animation.

The example below uses a fade-in animation.
Click on the buttons to toggle a milestone and observe the animation.
(The axes should appear with a fade-in effect and disappear abruptly.)

<Canvas>
    <Story name="entry milestones">
        <EntryMilestones />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Exit milestones

Props `exitOn` and `exit` are analogous to `initialOn` and `initial`, respectively, except that they determine how components disappear.

In the example below, the axes are present by default. Click on the buttons to toggle the milestones and observe the axes fade out.
(The axes should appear abruptly and disappear with a fade-out effect.)

<Canvas>
    <Story name="exit milestones">
        <ExitMilestones />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Entry and exit milestones

The entry and exit settings can be used together. In the example below, the left and right axes are configured to be invisible and visible by default, respectively.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="entry and exit milestones">
        <EntryExitMilestones />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

Some sequences of button clicks may produce similar effects, or not produce any changes at all.

For example, after setting milestone 'A', the left axis will be in view. In this state, toggling either milestone 'A' or 'B' will have the same effect, i.e. making the axis disappear. Revoking the 'A' milestone and triggering the exit milestone 'B' effectively give the same visual result.

As another example, after setting milestones 'A' and then 'B', the left axis will first appear into view and then disappear. Toggling milestone 'A' to make the left axis appear will not produce any effect because milestone 'B' signals the component should be invisible.

## Custom animations

Props `initial` and `exit` can be set with custom objects that create complex animations. In the example below, the entry animations include a slide from the left side. The exit animations include a zoom/scale effect.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="custom states">
        <EntryExitMilestones initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -80 }} exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 3 }} />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Transition

Prop `transition` accepts an object that specifies the speed properties of the animation.
The example below uses a spring-based transition with low 'mass' and low 'stiffness',
resulting in slow/gradual effect.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="custom transitions">
        <EntryExitMilestones
            initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
            exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
            transition={{ type: 'spring', mass: 0.5, stiffness: 20 }}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

Beside prop `transition`, it is also possible to adjust transitions via themes.
