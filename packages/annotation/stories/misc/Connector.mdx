# Connector

`Connector` creates a line between two positions.

<ArgTypes of={ConnectorStories} />

## Straight line

Prop `variant` toggles between various line types, and the single line type is the straight line.

<Canvas of={ConnectorStories.Line} />

## Arcs

Variants `arc-left` and `arc-right` create curved lines.

<Canvas of={ConnectorStories.ArcLeft} />
<Canvas of={ConnectorStories.ArcRight} />

Arc-based lines respond to props `rx`, `ry`, and `angle`, which parametrize an ellipse.

<Canvas of={ConnectorStories.Radii} />

The parametrization follows svg conventions for arcs described in the
[svg docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths#arcs).

## Segmented lines

Four variants create segmented lines.
A segmented connector can start as horizontal and then bend toward the finish,
start vertical and then bend toward the finish, or start at an angle.

<Canvas of={ConnectorStories.HStart} />
<Canvas of={ConnectorStories.VStart} />
<Canvas of={ConnectorStories.HEnd} />
<Canvas of={ConnectorStories.VEnd} />

The position where the slope of the segmented line changes is controlled with prop `elbow` and `elbowUnit`.
The default elbow value is 0.5 in relative units, which places the bend in the center of the line.
It is also possible to specify the elbow as a different fraction, or set it at an absolute distance.

<Canvas of={ConnectorStories.ElbowStartRelative} />
<Canvas of={ConnectorStories.ElbowStartAbsolute} />

In variants 'h-end' and 'v-end', the value of `elbow` is interpreted to refer to the
horizontal/vertical segment.

<Canvas of={ConnectorStories.ElbowEndRelative} />
<Canvas of={ConnectorStories.ElbowEndAbsolute} />

Note that the segmented variants have symmetry -
the shape created by 'h-end' can be equivalently generated with 'h-start' by reversing coordinates.
However, the variants are provided as the extended format to facilitate usage in higher level components
that may apply differential treatment to starting and ending positions.
