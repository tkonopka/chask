# ViewClip

<Meta of={ViewClipStories} />

`ViewClip` is an organizational component that restrict content to the bounds of a single view.

<ArgTypes of={ViewClipStories} />

`ViewClip` does not generate visible content.
However, it creates a clip mask and restricts all child elements to create content within that mask.
This can be useful for drawing views with bespoke scales, for example when using zoom operations.

## Identifier

Prop `id` assigns a unique identifier to a clip region.
This identifier is important when there are multiple clip regions in the same graphic
(e.g. in a chart with multiple views) or on the same page (in a web context).

Below are examples where a circle is drawn in a view without and with clipping.

<Canvas of={ViewClipStories.WithoutClip} />
<Canvas of={ViewClipStories.WithClip} />

## Expansion

While the default clip region coincides with a view, prop `expansion` extends the region in the
top, right, bottom, and left directions by a fixed distance.

<Canvas of={ViewClipStories.Expansion} />
