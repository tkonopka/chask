# View

<Meta of={ViewStories} />

`View` is an organizational component that manages chart state.
It does not display any visual elements on a chart, but it prepares data for display.
In particular, it defines scales for the axes and prepares data for plotting.

<ArgTypes of={ViewStories} />

## Coordinate systems

To see the effect of `View`, consider an `Axis` component drawn by itself (below, first example) and within a `View` component (below, second example).

<Canvas of={ViewStories.WithoutView} />
<Canvas of={ViewStories.WithView} />

In the first example above, without `View`, the axis does not have information about the scale or the extent of the axis.
It draws some ticks and labels, but the result is unsatisfactory.

In the second example above, a `View` component specified the extent of the drawing area and the scale for the axes.
The `Axis` component inside `View` can thus produce informative elements.
