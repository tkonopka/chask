# Add-ons

While package `@chsk/core` provides infrastructure for building chart skeletons,
practical visualizations often require additional elements.
Add-on packages introduce components for particular use-cases and to manage specific data types.

**`@chsk/annotation`** provides miscellaneous customization components

**`@chsk/band`** creates charts with one discrete (band) axis and one continuous axis, e.g. bar charts.

**`@chsk/matrix`** creates charts with two discrete (band) axes, e.g. heat maps.

**`@chsk/polar`** creates charts using polar coordinates, e.g. pie charts.

**`@chsk/set`** creates charts summarizing sets, e.g. Venn diagrams.

**`@chsk/themes`** holds objects that customize chart look-and-feel.

**`@chsk/xy`** creates charts with two continuous axes, e.g. scatter charts.
