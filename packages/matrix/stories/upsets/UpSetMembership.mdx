# UpSetMembership

<Meta of={UpSetMembershipStories} />

`UpSetMembership` draws a combination of symbols and a line in order to convey a pattern of set intersections in an upset chart.

`UpSetMembership` is a low-level component that is typically not invoked manually.
Rather, the component is used internally by `UpSetMemberships` to draw all nontrivial set intersections in a dataset.

## Positions

`UpSetMembership` displays either a single symbol, or a set of symbols connected by a line.
The positions of the symbols are set with prop `positions`, and the symbol size is determined by prop `r`.
Whenever there are more than two positions, the component automatically draws a line to connect the most extreme points.

<Canvas of={UpSetMembershipStories.MultiplePositions} />

Note that `UpSetMembership` draws symbols at the specified coordinates;
it does not check or enforce that the output is interpretable in the context of an upset chart.
