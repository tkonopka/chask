# Strips

<Meta of={StripsStories} />

`Strips` draws data points on a strip chart.

`Strips` is intended to be used within a `Strip` view.
Note that while the `Strips` component is the one that draws data points, much of the chart layout is determined by the parent view `Strip`.

<ArgTypes of={StripsStories} />

## Data subsets

By default, `Strips` draws the entire dataset. To draw subsets, set the props `ids` and `keys`.

<Canvas of={StripsStories.SelectedIds} />
<Canvas of={StripsStories.SelectedKeys} />

## Symbols

Prop `component` accepts a function for rendering individual data points.
The default function draws circles, but this can be replaced, for example, to create squares or other symbols.

<Canvas of={StripsStories.Symbols} />

See documentation in `@chsk/core` for symbols `Circle`, `Diamond`, `Square`, `Triangle`, `InvertedTriangle`.

## Mouse events

To make points respond to mouse events, set prop `handlers`.

<Canvas of={StripsStories.MouseClick} />

(Click on the data points, then check the browser console with `Ctrl Shift J` for output.)
