# Quantile

<Meta of={QuantileStories} />

`Quantile` sets up a view to summarize distributions, for example, using a box-and-whisker plot.
`Quantile` itself does not draw any visible elements, but it pre-processes a dataset so that the data can be visualized by other components, for example `Quantiles`.

<ArgTypes of={QuantileStories} />

## Data

Data should be prepared as an array of objects.
All objects should contain a string identifier `'id'`.
Other keys can hold arrays of numeric values.

The pseudocode below shows one data item with an identifier and two numeric arrays.
In this form, the numeric arrays will be treated as raw data points, and the component will compute appropriate quantiles.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "x": [1, 2, 3, ,...],
   "y": [2, 4, 6, ...],
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

Alternatively, the data can be provided as precomputed objects.
In this format, the keys should hold objects with five numeric values in field `values`,
five numeric quantile levels in `quantiles`, and two numeric values in `extrema`.
There should also be a numeric field `n`, representing the number of values in the original dataset.
The pseudocode below is an example.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "beta",
   "x": {
     "n": 10,
     "values": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
     "quantiles": [0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95],
     "extrema": [0, 6],
   }
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

## Orientation

Prop `horizontal` determines whether the boxes appear in the vertical or horizontal direction.

<Canvas of={QuantileStories.Vertical} />
<Canvas of={QuantileStories.Horizontal} />

## Other features

`Quantile` supports many of the same features as `Bar`, for example, for adjusting padding.
See the documentation for `Bar` for examples.
