# Violin

<Meta of={ViolinStories} />

`Violin` sets up a view for a violin chart.

<ArgTypes of={ViolinStories} />

## Data

Data should be prepared as an array of objects.
All objects should contain a string identifier `'id'`. Other keys with numeric values can be used to display distributions.

The pseudocode below shows one data item with an identifier and two numeric arrays.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "x": [1, 2, 3, ,...],
   "y": [2, 4, 6, ...],
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

## Orientation

Prop `horizontal` arranges the strips in the horizontal direction.

<Canvas of={ViolinStories.Vertical} />
<Canvas of={ViolinStories.Horizontal} />

## Breaks

Prop `breaks` determines the resolution of the violin shape.
This can be specified as a number, which indicates the number of bins, or as an array of breakpoints.

<Canvas of={ViolinStories.BreaksNumber} />
<Canvas of={ViolinStories.BreaksArray} />

## Other features

`Violin` supports many of the same features as `Bar`, for example, for adjusting padding.
See the documentation for `Bar` for examples.
