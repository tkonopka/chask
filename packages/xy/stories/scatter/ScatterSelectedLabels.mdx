# ScatterSelectedLabels

<Meta of={ScatterSelectedLabelsStories} />

`ScatterSelectedLabels` draws a set of labels on a scatter plot, automatically adjusting their positions to avoid overlaps.

<ArgTypes of={ScatterSelectedLabelsStories} />

## Data

`ScatterSelectedLabels` requires a data object specifying the data points to label.
This object should be an array, with each element holding an `id` of the data series,
an `index` specifying the data point in the series, a `size` array to set the
dimensions for the label, and a `content` field.

The pseudocode below demonstrates the required format.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "index": 0,
   "size": [60, 25],
   "content": "label content"
   },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

## Label position

The position of each label is determined automatically.
By default, a label appear directly above a data point.
If placing a label above a data point would interfere with existing data points,
the labels may shift slightly, as in the second example below.

## Offset

Prop `offset` determines an initial shift of the label from its associated data point.
This prop can determine if a label is pushed above, below, or to the side of the data.

Note that values in this prop should be small.
The values are only meant to orient the initial direction of label displacement;
after the initial displacement, much of the label adjustments are determined by prop `clearance` (see below).

## Clearance

Prop `clearance` determines the space between a data point and its label.
The value is a guide only, and actual distances between data points and labels may vary as a result of
data configurations, including data point radii.

## Symbol

Prop `symbol` accepts a function for creating symbols for data points.
By default, `symbol` is unspecified and `ScatterSelectedLabels` creates only text labels.
Setting this prop to a non-null function can be useful to highlight the data points that are associated with labels.
The prop is often used together with `symbolStyle` and `symbolClassName`.

Below, several data points are located near one another.
The text label is automatically placed away from the data points to avoid overlaps, and custom styling can help
convey that the label is associated with a specific data point.

<Canvas of={ScatterSelectedLabelsStories.Grid} />

Note that `symbol` does not change the existing data point, but rather creates a new object at the same location.
This can disrupt mouse interactions linked with the data point.
To preserve such interactions, set `pointerEvents: 'none'` in the symbol style, or in the chart theme.

## Connector

Prop `connector` accepts a function for creating lines between the data point and the label.
By default, `connector` is unspecified and `ScatterSelectedLabels` does not draw any connector.
A suitable value is the `Line` component, which draws a straight connecting line.

<Canvas of={ScatterSelectedLabelsStories.Connector} />

In the example above, the line overlaps the data point as well as the text label.
An improved appearance can be achieved by using the connector along with `symbol` (see above)
and a custom text style.

## Custom components

Further adjustments should typically be delegated to custom implementations for props `component`,
`symbol`, and `connector`. The add-on package `@chsk/annotation` offers some support in this direction.
