# ScatterCrosshair

<Meta of={ScatterCrosshairStories} />

`ScatterCrosshair` detects mouse motion and draws crosshair lines to highlight a nearby data point.

<ArgTypes of={ScatterCrosshairStories} />

## Variants

The default `ScatterCrosshair` component tracks the mouse pointer and finds the nearest data point.
The component calculates distances using the Euclidean metric in two dimensions.

<Canvas of={ScatterCrosshairStories.Default} />

Prop `variant` changes the calculation of nearest data point.
Variants `x` and `y` use only the horizontal and vertical positions, respectively.

<Canvas of={ScatterCrosshairStories.X} />
<Canvas of={ScatterCrosshairStories.Y} />

## Lines

Prop `visible` toggles visibility of the horizontal and vertical crosshair lines.

<Canvas of={ScatterCrosshairStories.Horizontal} />
<Canvas of={ScatterCrosshairStories.Vertical} />

## Minimum distance

Prop `minDistance` sets a minimal distance between the mouse pointer and the nearest data point.

<Canvas of={ScatterCrosshairStories.MinimumDistance} />

## Detector area

By default, `ScatterCrosshair` detects mouse event at positions within the chart view, but the detector region
can be tuned using prop `expansion`.
A nontrivial expansion triggers the crosshair lines even when the mouse pointer is outside of the chart view,
i.e. beyond the extent of the axes.

## Custom symbol

Once `ScatterCrosshair` determines an active data point and draws crosshair lines, it also creates a new symbol
on top of the existing chart.
(This ensures that the data symbol is not covered by the crosshair lines.)
The default symbol is a circle, but it can be tuned with props `symbol`, `symbolStyle`, and `symbolClassName`.

<Canvas of={ScatterCrosshairStories.CustomSymbol2} />

## Tooltip

`ScatterCrosshair` automatically sets data for a tooltip.
To activate a tooltip, use a `Tooltip` component.

<Canvas of={ScatterCrosshairStories.Tooltip} />

## Style modifiers

Prop `modifiers` is a group of styles applied to the detector surface.
This can be used, for example, to change the cursor when the mouse hovers near a data point.
