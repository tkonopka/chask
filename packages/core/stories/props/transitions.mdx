# Transitions

All chart transitions are implemented using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/).
They can be configured globally or adjusted in individual components.

## Global configuration

The default animation settings can be set via a global chart theme using key `Transition`.
The example below specifies a spring-based animation.

<Source
    language="jsx"
    code={`
const customTheme = {
  Transition: {
    default: {
      type: 'spring',
      mass: 0.5,
      stiffness: 250,
      damping: 25,
    }
  }
}`}
/>

Settings that can be included in the configuration include `duration`, `bounce`, `mass`, `stiffness`, and `damping`.
For detailed description of their role in animations, see the [framer motion documentation](https://www.framer.com/docs/transition/).
Some rules of thumb are:

-   Larger stiffness increases responsiveness, i.e. makes animations seem to begin faster.
-   Larger damping reduces oscillations.

To apply custom animation settings, use prop `theme` in the `Chart` component.
The custom settings will then apply to all components within that chart.

<Source
    language="jsx"
    code={`
<Chart {...props} theme={customTheme}>
  ...
</Chart>`}
/>

A custom theme can also include a dictionary under `Transition.tooltip`.
Those transition settings will affect motion of tooltip.

## Component-specific settings

Several shape and typography components include a prop `transition`, which can be used to
adjust animation settings for individual components.

The example below defines a custom tween-based animation that lasts one second.

<Source
    language="jsx"
    code={`
const customTransition = {
  type: 'tween',
  duration: 1,
}`}
/>

The custom transition specification can be passed to a component such as `Rectangle`.

<Source
    language="jsx"
    code={`
<Rectangle {...props} transition={customTransition} />
`}
/>

Note that a custom transition will only become noticeable if external logic changes the other props to the component,
triggering a re-rendering of the component.
In practice, rather than providing custom transitions directly to shape components, it is more common to specify
custom transitions as part of `componentProps` in higher-order components.
