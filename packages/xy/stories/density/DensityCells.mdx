# DensityCells

<Meta of={DensityCellsStories} />

`DensityCells` draws a collection of cells to summarize data density as a heat map.

<ArgTypes of={DensityCellsStories} />

## Transparency

Prop `transparency` toggles an opacity transformation.
The default setting is to enable the opacity transformation.
This results in cells with color intensity that scales with the number of points in a region,
thus de-emphasizing regions with only a few data points.

<Canvas of={DensityCellsStories.NoTransparency} />

Both modes use color blending to capture composition of each cell.

## Cells

By default, the map is drawn using the `DensitySimpleCell` component, which displays shapes without any animations.
Prop `cell` accepts other drawing functions.
For example, `DensityCell` can be used to animate color transitions.
