# Download

`Download` provides a click-able object that triggers a download of chart content into a file.

<ArgTypes of={DownloadStories} />

## Data download

Set prop `variant` to `'data'` to fetch the raw data associated with a view (in `json` format).

The example below uses a simple `Bar` view; click the text above the bars to download the raw data for the bars.

<Canvas of={DownloadStories.DataDownload} />

## Image download

Set prop `variant` to `'image'` to fetch an image of the entire chart (in `svg` format).

<Canvas of={DownloadStories.ImageDownload} />

Note that the downloaded image may appear slightly different, when previewed offline, than in the browser.
This is usually because of discrepancies in font faces.
In particular, the generic font face 'sans-serif' may be interpreted differently in different contexts.
To maximize consistency, use a specific font face that is available across all target platforms.
