# GridLines

<Meta of={GridLinesStories} />

`GridLines` draws a set of grid lines on a chart.

<ArgTypes of={GridLinesStories} />

## Variants

There are a number of predefined variants, which can be activated via the prop `variant`. Below, the grid lines are displayed on a gray background surface.

<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.GridX} />
<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.GridY} />

## Styling

Grid lines can be styled using css.
Below are examples with both horizontal and vertical gridlines.

<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.DashedGridLines} />
<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.NegativeLines} />

## Line positions

Positions can be set via the prop `values`.

<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.CustomPositions} />

## Expansion

By default, grid lines run across the entire chart view.
It is possible to adjust their extent - make them longer or shorter - using the prop `expansion`.

<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.LineExtent} />

## Band scales

For band scales, grid lines appear at the center of each band by default.
It is possible to move the guide lines using prop `shift`, which takes an array of values.

<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.Band} />
<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.BetweenBands} />

Values in the `shift` array are interpreted as multiples of a base unit associated with the band scale.
The base unit is set with prop `shiftUnit`.
The shift unit `band` corresponds to the width of a bar on a bar chart.
Unit `step`, which is the default, corresponds to the width of a bar on a bar chart plus surrounding padding.
