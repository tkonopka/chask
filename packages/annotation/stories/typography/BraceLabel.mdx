# BraceLabel

`BraceLabel` displays a brace and a text label. A 'brace' is a line that forms a shape like '{' or '}'.

<ArgTypes of={BraceLabelStories} />

## Brace shape

The features that distinguish `BraceLabel` from `LineLabel` are curves at the ends of the line and a pinch in the middle of the line.
The shape of these curves is determined by props `tickSize` and `braceR`.

<Canvas of={BraceLabelStories.WideCurves} />

## Other settings

`BraceLabel` shares many props and features with `LineLabel`, for example with regard to orientation of text, rotations, and styling.
See documentation for `LineLabel` for details.
