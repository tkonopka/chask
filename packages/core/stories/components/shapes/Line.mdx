# Line

<Meta of={LineStories} />

`Line` draws a single line on a chart.

<ArgTypes of={LineStories} />

## Variants

There are a number of predefined variants, which can be activated via the prop `variant`.

<Canvas of={LineStories.Tick} />
<Canvas of={LineStories.Grid} />

The examples above show variants `tick` and `grid`. Other variants include `default` and `axis`.
(The default theme does not display a line for axes, hence it would not be useful to display an example.)

## Styles

It is possible to adjust individual lines using css.

<Canvas of={LineStories.Color} />
<Canvas of={LineStories.Dasharray} />
