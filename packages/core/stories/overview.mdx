# Core

Package `@chsk/core` provides infrastructure for building dynamic highly-customizable charts.

**Components** are the building blocks for charts.
Many components, for example `<Axis>`, create visual elements that appear within a chart. A few components, for example `<View>`, do not create visual output, but rather organize information for other components.

**Hooks** are functions that enable components to access chart state. For many use-cases, complete charts can be created with core components and add-on packages, without the need to use hooks directly. However, the functions can be useful for creating bespoke components.

**Props** are the inputs to component functions. In `@chsk`, all props are associated with typescript types. In addition, many props are shared and reused across many components. Some dedicated pages outline the ideas behind these common props.

## Skeletons

Components in `@chsk/core` can be combined to produce chart skeletons with distinctive visual features.

<Canvas of={OverviewStories.Default} />
<Canvas of={OverviewStories.Grid} />
<Canvas of={OverviewStories.InverseGrid} />
<Canvas of={OverviewStories.Boxed} />
<Canvas of={OverviewStories.BoxedWithGrid} />
<Canvas of={OverviewStories.SmallLabels} />

Note that several of these examples use inline styles to tune appearance.
This enables comparisons between the various skeletons, but it can make the code verbose.
To simplify the code, the styles can be incorporated into a chart theme.
