# MilestoneMotion

<Meta of={MilestoneMotionStories} />

`MilestoneMotion` is an organizational component.
It does not draw anything itself, but it controls when its children elements appear and disappear.

Charts keep track of a set of 'milestones', which can be toggled on and off, for example using buttons.
`MilestoneMotion` components detect changes in the milestones and trigger the visibility of their children elements.

<ArgTypes of={MilestoneMotionStories} />

## Setup

Setting up a chart for milestone animations is a two-step process.

First, create a `Ref` object and pass it to prop `fref` of the `Chart` component.
The pseudo-code below shows the key ideas.

<Source
  language="javascript"
  code={`
  // relevant imports
  import { Chart, ChartRef } from '@chsk/core'

// set up a ref
const ref = useRef<ChartRef>(null)

// pass the ref to the chart

  <Chart fref={ref} ...>
  ...
  </Chart>
  `}
/>

Second, set up UI components (e.g. buttons) with event handlers that access the chart's state and toggle milestone labels.
This is achieved using the `ref` object declared above and with function `toggleMilestone`.
The pseudo-code below shows a hypothetical handler that toggles a label 'A'.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  // handler for a UI component
  const onClick = () => {
  ref?.current?.toggleMilestone('A')
  }
  `}
/>

Altogether, setting up a chart to use milestones can involve multiple parts working together.
The source code for the examples on this page is available in the
[source repository](https://github.com/tkonopka/chsk/blob/main/packages/core/stories/components/Milestone.animations.tsx).

## Entry animation

Prop `enterOn` specifies the milestone at which a component should appear into view. Prop `enter` specifies the initial state of the animation.

The example below sets prop `enter` to the string `hidden` to achieve a fade-in effect.
Click on the buttons to toggle a milestone and observe the animation.

<Canvas of={MilestoneMotionStories.Entry} />

(Above, axes should appear appear gradually and disappear abruptly.
The abrupt change is achieved by setting prop `exit` to `null`.)

## Exit animation

Props `exitOn` and `exit` are analogous to `enterOn` and `enter`, respectively,
except that they determine how components disappear.

In the example below, prop `exit` is set to the string `hidden` to achieve a fade-out effect.
Click on the buttons to toggle the milestones and make the axes fade out.

<Canvas of={MilestoneMotionStories.Exit} />

(Above, axes should appear abruptly and disappear gradually.
The abrupt effect is achieved by setting `enter` to `null`.)

## Milestone interactions

The entry and exit settings can be used together.
In the example below, the left and right axes are configured to be invisible and visible by default, respectively.

<Canvas of={MilestoneMotionStories.EntryAndExit} />

Some sequences of button clicks may produce similar effects, or not produce any changes at all.

For example, consider setting milestone 'A' so that the left axis is in view.
In this state, toggling either milestone 'A' or 'B' will have the same effect - both these changes should make the axis disappear.

As another example, consider setting milestones 'A' and then 'B'.
The left axis should first appear into view and then disappear.
Toggling milestone 'A' in this state to make the left axis appear will not produce any effect because milestone 'B' signals the component should be invisible.

## Custom animation states

In the examples, props `enter` and `exit` were set to the string `hidden` or to `null` to achieve simple fade-in/fade-out effects.
These props can also accept custom objects to create more complex animations.
Below, entry animations include a slide from the left side and exit animations use a zoom/scale effect.

<Canvas of={MilestoneMotionStories.CustomStates} />

## Transition

Prop `transition` accepts an object that specifies the properties of the animation.
The example below uses a spring-based transition with low 'mass' and low 'stiffness',
resulting in slow/gradual effect.

<Canvas of={MilestoneMotionStories.CustomTransitions} />

It is also possible to adjust transitions via themes.

## Custom actions

Props `onEnter` and `onExit` accept custom functions that are executed when the
chart reaches the relevant milestones.

The example below uses custom functions to log to the console.

<Canvas of={MilestoneMotionStories.CustomActions} />

(Toggle the milestones, then open the console with `Ctrl Shift J` to see logging messages.)
