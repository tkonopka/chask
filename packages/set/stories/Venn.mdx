# Venn

<Meta of={VennStories} />

`Venn` sets up a view for a Venn diagram with two or three sets.

<ArgTypes of={VennStories} />

## Data

Data should be prepared as an array of objects.
All objects should contain a string identifier `id` and an array of elements `data`.
The array will be treated as a set, and the Venn chart will summarize overlaps between those sets.

The pseudocode below shows one data item with an identifier and an array with four string elements.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "data": ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

## Separation

By default, sets are positioned at fixed locations in the view, irrespective of their sizes (number of elements) or extent of overlap (number of shared elements).
The distance between sets is determined by prop `separation`.

<Canvas of={VennStories.LittleSeparation} />

## Disjoint sets

Sets that do not overlap are positioned further apart.

<Canvas of={VennStories.Disjoint} />

## Proportional areas

For datasets with two sets, it is possible to compute sizes that reflect the number of elements in the sets and the number of common elements.
This feature is toggled with prop `proportional`.

<Canvas of={VennStories.ProportionalLargeOverlap} />
<Canvas of={VennStories.AContainedInB} />
<Canvas of={VennStories.BContainedInA} />
<Canvas of={VennStories.ProportionalDisjoint} />

## Number of sets

`Venn` can also accept datasets with just one set, or three sets.

<Canvas of={VennStories.OneSet} />
<Canvas of={VennStories.ThreeSets} />

Note that proportional areas are only supported for diagrams with two sets.

To visualize datasets with more than three sets, see the `UpSet` chart in the `@chsk/matrix` package.

## Orientation

The arrangement of sets can be rotated with prop `angle`.

<Canvas of={VennStories.RotatedTwoSets} />
<Canvas of={VennStories.RotatedThreeSets} />

## Sizing

To adjust the appearance of the sets on the chart, set custom scales using prop `scaleX` or `scaleY`.

<Canvas of={VennStories.CustomSize} />

## Color interpolation

Colors for sets are determined by the color scale (via prop `scaleColor` or via themes).
Colors for intersections are determined by interpolation between the set colors.
The default interpolation can adjusted with a custom function with prop `interpolation`.

For charts with only two sets, `interpolation` is only called once.
It can therefore just return the desired color for the intersection.
For charts with three sets, the function is called several times,
and should thus handle combinations of two and three set colors.
