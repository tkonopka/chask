# ScatterLabel

<Meta of={ScatterLabelStories} />

`ScatterLabel` draws a label on a scatter plot.

<ArgTypes of={ScatterLabelStories} />

## Position

The position of the label is specified with prop `position` and an accompanying `positionUnit`.

The position can be specified as a single value. In this case, the value is interpreted as the x coordinate.
`ScatterLabel` retrieves a data point nearby that x position, and determines the vertical location for the label.

<Canvas of={ScatterLabelStories.Points} />

Prop `position` can also be given as a two-component array. In that case, `ScatterLabel` finds the nearest
data point to that position, and places the location there.

## Rotation

The label can be rotated with prop `angle`.
Alternatively, a prop `autoRotate` can compute a relevant rotation angle.
