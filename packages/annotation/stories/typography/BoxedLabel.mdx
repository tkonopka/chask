# BoxedLabel

`BoxedLabel` displays a text label enclosed in a rectangle.

<ArgTypes of={BoxedLabelStories} />

`BoxedLabel` is closely related to `BoxedTitle`, but it offers more control of positioning.

## Position

The prop `position` marks a location on the chart / view. This can be specified with absolute values `[x, y]`, or as fractions of the chart / view dimensions.
In the latter case, the prop `units` should be set to `'relative'`.

## Anchors

The prop `anchor` determines what part of the label is aligned with the point on the chart designated by `position`.

<Canvas of={BoxedLabelStories.AnchorTopLeftCorner} />
<Canvas of={BoxedLabelStories.AnchorTopRightCorner} />

## Offset

The prop `offset` accepts an array `[x, y]`, which shifts the position of the label.
The translation works together with other props, in particular `position`, and it can be used to place a label off-center or adjacent to a corner.

## Rotation

The box and the label can be rotated using prop `angle`.
