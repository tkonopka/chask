# Themes

Package `@chsk/themes` provides a collection of objects that adjust the look-and-feel of charts.

At the technical level, theme objects are dictionaries that satisfy typescript type `ThemeSpec` from `@chsk/core`.
In practice, the objects define values for arguments for core chart components (e.g. `Axis`, `Legend`).
They also hold css styles for svg components (e.g. `line`, `text`).

The content in package `@chsk/themes` is organized into three categories:

-   **complete themes** are objects that overhaul props and css styles for many library components, providing a unique look-and-feel;
-   **partial themes** are adjustments that affect substantial parts of a chart, but also leave many other elements unchanged;
-   **theme pieces** are even more targeted adjustments, for example, affecting only elements with specific class names.

The distinction between these categories is fuzzy and does not carry deep meaning.
It is primarily an attempt to organize the package to manage development and documentation.

All theme objects can be combined using `mergeTheme` and `mergeThemes` utilities in `@chsk/core`, and passed to
`Chart` objects using the `theme` prop.
