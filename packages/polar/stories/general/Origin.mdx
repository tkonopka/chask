# Origin

<Meta of={OriginStories} />

`Origin` moves the svg coordinate system.

<ArgTypes of={OriginStories} />

## Usage

`Origin` is intended to be used as an immediate child of a view component, e.g. `Pie`.
Whereas svg coordinates in a view are centered on the top-left corner of the view,
`Origin` introduces an svg `g` element that moves the origin of the coordinate system to the center.
This is important for components such as `Slices`.

<Canvas of={OriginStories.WithoutOrigin} />
<Canvas of={OriginStories.WithOrigin} />
