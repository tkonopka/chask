`GridItem` is an organizational component to be used within a `Grid` environment.
It does not display any visual elements, but it sets up a local container that matches a cell in a grid.

## Position

Prop `position` specifies a location in a grid.
This prop interprets values as x- and y- indexes in the grid: a value _\[i, j]_ corresponds to column _i_ and row _j_.

The example below sets up a 3x3 grid.
A `GridItem` creates a local coordinate system in one of the cells, and a `Surface` component fills the cell with color.

<Canvas of={GridItemStories.Position} />

## Index

Prop `index` is an alternative way to specify a location in a grid.

An index provided as a single number is interpreted using grid linearization (see prop `variant` in `Grid`).
When index consists of a pair of integers, they are interpreted as row and column indexes:
a value of _\[i, j]_ corresponds to row _i_ and column _j_.
(Note this is opposite to prop `position`.)
