# UpSet

<Meta of={UpSetStories} />

`UpSet` sets up a view for an upset chart, which summarizes relationships between sets.
The chart design is motivated and explained [here](https://upset.app/).

Note that the `UpSet` component does not draw any visible elements;
it only pre-processes a dataset so that it can be visualized with other components, for example `UpSetMemberships` and `UpSetGrid`.
The examples on this page use `UpSetGrid` in order to display the effect of `UpSet` settings on child elements.

<ArgTypes of={UpSetStories} />

## Data

Data should be prepared as an array of objects that represent sets.
The objects should contain a string identifier `id` and an array `data` holding the unique elements of the set.

The pseudocode below shows one object with a data array that contains four strings.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "data": ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

## Orientation

`UpSet` charts can be arranged horizontally (default) or vertically.
The orientation is toggled with prop `horizontal`.

<Canvas of={UpSetStories.Default} />
<Canvas of={UpSetStories.Vertical} />

## Symbol size

Symbols are sized automatically to fill the space available in each row / column. The apparent size can be tuned, however, by adjusting the padding for the x-axis and y-axis band scales.

## `HeatMap` components

Some components designed for heat maps can also be used within `UpSet` views.
In particular, `HeatMapSurface` can provide outlines or background colors for the UpSet grid.

<Canvas of={UpSetStories.Outline} />
<Canvas of={UpSetStories.BackgroundStripes} />
