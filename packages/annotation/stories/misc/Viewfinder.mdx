# Viewfinder

`Viewfinder` displays corners of a rectangle in a pattern resembling a camera viewfinder.

<ArgTypes of={ViewfinderStories} />

## Variant

Prop `variant` determines the appearance of the viewfinder decorations.
The default variant `corners` creates lines at all four corners of a rectangle.

<Canvas of={ViewfinderStories.Corners} />

Two other variants, `top-left-bottom-right` and `top-right-bottom-left`, create pairs of opposite corners.

<Canvas of={ViewfinderStories.TopLeftBottomRight} />
<Canvas of={ViewfinderStories.TopRightBottomLeft} />

The remaining variants create individual corners.

## Corner size

The size of the lines in the corners is controlled with prop `lengths` and `lengthsUnits`.

<Canvas of={ViewfinderStories.AbsLengths} />
<Canvas of={ViewfinderStories.RelLengths} />

## Corner radius

The API for `Viewfinder` includes props `rx` and `ry` for compatibility with `Rectangle`.
However, these props have no effect.
