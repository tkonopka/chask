# InsetColorFilter

`InsetColorFilter` creates an svg filter that applies a solid color mask.

<ArgTypes of={InsetColorFilterStories} />

## Color and opacity

Prop `floodColor` determines the color of the mask.
Prop `floodOpacity` determines the intensity of the filter.

Each of the examples below shows a shape with a regular fill and the same shape with a filter.

<Canvas of={InsetColorFilterStories.Lighter} />
<Canvas of={InsetColorFilterStories.Darker} />

## Inset

By default, `InsetColorFilter` affects the entire shape, including the boundary.
To exclude the boundary from the filter, set prop `erodeR` with the width of the boundary stroke.

<Canvas of={InsetColorFilterStories.Inset} />

Note that the filter appears to affect only the inside of the shape because `erodeR` is matched with the boundary stroke width.
The matching must be done manually. Otherwise, the filter can affect only a part of the object.
