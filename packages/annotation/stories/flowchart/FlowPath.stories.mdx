# FlowPath

export const Template = args => <FlowPath {...args} />

`FlowPath` creates an animated path.

<ArgsTable of={FlowPath} />

## Trajectory

The trajectory of `FlowPath` is determined by a series of points specified in prop `points`. There can be as few as two points to create a single line segment, or many points to create a complex path.

Click the milestone buttons in the examples below to see the animation.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="simple line">
        <FlowMilestones
            points={[
                ['A', 80],
                ['D', 80],
            ]}
        />
    </Story>
    <Story name="complex line">
        <FlowMilestones
            points={[
                ['A', 80],
                ['D', 80],
                ['D', 20],
                ['B', 20],
                ['B', 70],
            ]}
            style={{ fillOpacity: 0 }}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

Note that for the animation to show-up correctly, the `fill-opacity` css attribute should be set to 0 for the path.
This can be achieved via themes, or by providing a `style` prop.

## Curves

By default, `FlowPath` connects points with straight, i.e. linear, segments. Other interpolations between points can be set with prop `curve`.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="natural curve">
        <FlowMilestones
            points={[
                ['A', 80],
                ['D', 80],
                ['D', 20],
                ['B', 20],
                ['B', 70],
            ]}
            curve={'Natural'}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Transitions

The duration of the animation (and other animation settings) can be adjusted via prop `transition`.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="slow transition">
        <FlowMilestones
            points={[
                ['A', 80],
                ['D', 80],
                ['D', 20],
                ['B', 20],
                ['B', 70],
            ]}
            curve={'Natural'}
            transition={{ pathLength: { duration: 3 } }}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Styling

Paths can be styled using css. Note, however, that the animation (managed by framer-motion) utilises property `strokeDasharray`, and this property should not be modified with custom settings.
