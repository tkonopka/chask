# Label

<Meta of={LabelStories} />

`Label`, similarly to `Typography`, places a text element on a chart.
It differs from `Typography` in how the props determine the localisation of the text element.

<ArgTypes of={LabelStories} />

## Base position

Prop `position` determines the location of the label anchor point.
By default, `Label` creates text that is centered around the anchor point.
Thus, the result is very similar as that produced by `Typography`.

## Alignment

`Label` provides props other than `position` that tune the position of the text.
To understand how the placement is computed, imagine a rectangle centered around `position`.
The size of the rectangle is determined by prop `size`. The internal padding is set
with prop `padding`. The text label is then placed within the accessible rectangle,
and aligned according to prop `align`.

In each of examples below, `position` is marked with a small circle.
Two concentric rectangles enclose the circle.
The dimensions of the outer rectangle correspond to prop `size`.
The inner rectangle is offset from the outer rectangle according to `padding`.
Finally, the text element is aligned at a location within the inner rectangle.

In the first example below, the text is aligned `[0, 0.5]`, i.e. to left side in the middle of the inner rectangle.
The style of the text element uses `textAnchor: 'start'`.
In the second example, prop `align=[1, 0.5]` to align the text on the right side of the inner rectangle.
The style of that text element uses `textAnchor: 'end'`.

<Canvas of={LabelStories.AlignedMiddleRight} />

## Anchor

The examples above explain how the position of the text is calculated with the aid of a rectangle centered around `position`.
Prop `anchor` changes how that rectangle is positioned relative to `position`.
In the example below, `anchor` is set to `[0, 0]` so that the rectangle's top-left corner matches with `position`.
