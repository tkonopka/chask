# Schedule

<Meta of={ScheduleStories} />

`Schedule` sets up a view for a chart displaying intervals (also referred to as 'Gantt chart').
`Schedule` itself does not draw any visible elements, but it pre-processes a dataset so that the data can be visualized by other components, for example `Schedules`.

<ArgTypes of={ScheduleStories} />

## Data

Data should be prepared as an array of objects.
All objects should contain a string identifier `'id'` and an array `'data'`.
The data array should contain objects that define a key string, as well as interval start- and end-points.
The key string can be used to toggle visibility of certain intervals.

The pseudocode below shows one data item with an array of three intervals.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "data": [
     {"key": "x", "start": 1, "end": 3},
     {"key": "y", "start": 4, "end": 6},
     {"key": "z", "start": 7, "end": 9}
   ],
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

## Orientation

Prop `horizontal` determines the orientation of the intervals.

<Canvas of={ScheduleStories.Vertical} />

## Other features

`Schedule` supports many of the same features as `Bar`, for example, for adjusting padding.
See the documentation for `Bar` for examples.
