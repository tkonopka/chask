# BandSurface

<Meta of={BandSurfaceStories} />

`BandSurface` creates rectangles that highlight bands.

<ArgTypes of={BandSurfaceStories} />

## Variant

Prop `variant` clarifies the definition of a band surface.
Variant 'step' creates a surface that includes the content of a band and also covers padding our the content.
Variant 'band' omits the padding.

<Canvas of={BandSurfaceStories.Step} />
<Canvas of={BandSurfaceStories.Band} />

## Data subsets

Use prop `ids` to specify the bands to highlight.

<Canvas of={BandSurfaceStories.Subset} />

## Interactivity

Flag `interactive` activates interactivity.

<Canvas of={BandSurfaceStories.Interactive} />

Above, hovering on the band makes the band surface appear, but moving the mouse onto the bars
within a band makes the interactive band surface disappear.
One way to maintain the surface while hovering on the bars is to include a style `pointer-events: 'none'`.
This style can be set inline or via themes.

<Canvas of={BandSurfaceStories.PointerEvents} />

## Tooltip

Another way to activate the surfaces is with prop `tooltip`.
Setting this flag indicates that a surface should become visible based on data from the tooltip context.

<Canvas of={BandSurfaceStories.Tooltip} />

Note that setting `tooltip` makes the surface appear when the mouse hovers on the bars, and not
on the empty space. To activate both behaviors, set both `tooltip` and `interactive`.
