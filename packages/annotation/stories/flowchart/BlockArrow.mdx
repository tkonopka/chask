# BlockArrow

`BlockArrow` displays a thick arrow.

<ArgTypes of={BlockArrowStories} />

## Arrow shape

The shape of the arrow is determined by props `stemWidth`, `headWidth`, and `headLength`.

<Canvas of={BlockArrowStories.Narrow} />
<Canvas of={BlockArrowStories.Wide} />

## Variants

Prop `variant` further determines the arrow shape, with variant `caret` introducing an indentation at the arrow base.

## Arrow heads

By default, `BlockArrow` creates an arrowhead only at the end position.
Arrowheads can be configured at each side via prop `heads`.
