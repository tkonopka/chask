# ScatterInterval

<Meta of={ScatterIntervalStories} />

`ScatterInterval` draws a polygon intended as an interval around a curve

<ArgTypes of={ScatterIntervalStories} />

## Interval bounds

`ScatterInterval` shapes are characterized, for value along the x-axis, with a lower- and an upper value on the y-axis.
These bounds are extracted from data using keys set with props `lower` and `upper`.

## Convolution and down-sampling

Similarly to `ScatterCurve`, ScatterInterval\` accepts signal-processing props related to convolution and down-sampling.
The example below shows the same data as before, with a moving average of three points and down-sampling by a factor of 0.5.
