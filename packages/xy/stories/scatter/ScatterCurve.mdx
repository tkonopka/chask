# ScatterCurve

<Meta of={ScatterCurveStories} />

`ScatterCurve` draws a curve based on a data series.

<ArgTypes of={ScatterCurveStories} />

## Curves

The prop `curve` controls the type of interpolation between points.

<Canvas of={ScatterCurveStories.LinearCurve} />
<Canvas of={ScatterCurveStories.StepCurve} />

Note that `ScatterCurve` uses all the points in a series, and connects points in the order provided.
For noisy data, this may produce spiky lines.
To display a best-fit line instead, see `ScatterRegression`.

## Multiple series

Use `ScatterCurve` multiple times to overlay multiple series.
Each series can have a distinct curve setting and css style.

## Down-sampling

By default, `ScatterCurve` draws a line through all the data points in a series.
To reduce the complexity of the curve, set prop `downsampleFactor` to use a fraction of the data points.
The relevant points are extracted at regular intervals.
A prop `downsampleIndex` determines the first data point of the down-sampled curve.

<Canvas of={ScatterCurveStories.DownsampleIndex1} />

The examples above show that starting down-sampling from different data points can produce quite different curve shapes.
This makes down-sampling, when used on its own, unreliable as a smoothing technique.
However, it can be attractive when used together with convolution (see next section).

## Convolution

`ScatterCurve` can perform a convolution of the data with an array-like mask.
This can be used to display moving averages of various types: simple / historical moving average, symmetrical averages,
and weighted averages.

The properties of the convolution are specified in prop `convolutionMask` and prop `convolutionOffset`.
For example, in a time-series context, it may be desirable to compute a moving average of three time points in the immediate past.
This would correspond to a mask `[1, 1, 1]` and an offset of `0` (the default).
In another context, it may be desirable to compute a smoothing curve by averaging three nearby data points in a symmetrical fashion.
This would be achieved by setting the convolution offset to `-1`.

<Canvas of={ScatterCurveStories.SymmetricAverage} />

Note that the domain of the resulting curve shifts depending on `convolutionOffset`.

Once a curve is smoothed with convolution, it may be attractive to perform down-sampling.

<Canvas of={ScatterCurveStories.AveragedDownsampledIndex0} />
<Canvas of={ScatterCurveStories.AveragedDownsampledIndex1} />

The two examples above, which differ in `downsampleIndex`, produce qualitatively similar shapes.
As such, the arbitrary aspects of down-sampling become less pronounced after convolution.
