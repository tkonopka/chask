# GridStripes

`GridStripes` displays rectangular stripes to mark regions along an axis.

<ArgTypes of={GridStripesStories} />

## Variants

Prop `variant` toggles between vertical and horizontal stripes that mark regions along the x- and y-axis.

<Canvas of={GridStripesStories.X} />
<Canvas of={GridStripesStories.Y} />

## Parity

`GridStripes`, like 'GridLines', divides an axis into regions. Whereas `GridLines` draws lines at the
boundaries between these regions, `GridStripes` draws rectangles in alternating regions.
Prop `parity` determines whether these rectangles appear in even or odd-indexed regions.

<Canvas of={GridStripesStories.Even} />
<Canvas of={GridStripesStories.Odd} />

To draw alternating stripes with different colors / styles, use two separate `GridStripes` components.

## Shift

Prop `shift` adjusts the position of region boundaries on band scales.
This can be used to create stripes between adjacent bands or to highlight alternating bands.

<Canvas of={GridStripesStories.BetweenBands} />
<Canvas of={GridStripesStories.CenteredOnBands} />

## Other props

`GridStripes` shares many props with `GridLines` from the `@chsk/core` package.
See the documentation for `GridLines` for further details.
