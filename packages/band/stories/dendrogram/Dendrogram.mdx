# Dendrogram

<Meta of={DendrogramStories} />

`Dendrogram` sets up a view for a dendrogram chart. `Dendrogram` itself does not draw any visible elements, but it pre-processes a dataset so that the data can be visualized by other components, for example `DendrogramTree`.

<ArgTypes of={DendrogramStories} />

## Data

For consistency with data objects in other views, dendrogram data should be prepared as an array of objects.
In `Dendrogram`, however, this array will have, in most common use cases, only a single item.

The data item should contain the following fields:

-   'id' with an identifier string
-   'ids' should contain a list of all the leaf nodes in the dendrogram;
-   'merge' should contain pairs of integers that indicate the dendrogram hierarchy;
-   'height' should contain a list of values that specify the position of each hierarchy step.

The pseudocode below shows one data item with an identifier and three numeric values.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "ids": ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
   "merge": [[-1, -2], [-3, -4], [1, 2]],
   "height": [0.25, 0.5, 0.75],
  }
  ]
  `}
/>

The data format follows closely the output from `hclust` in the R environment.
See the [R documentation](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/hclust.html) for further details.

## Variants

Prop `variant` ...

<Canvas of={DendrogramStories.Top} />
<Canvas of={DendrogramStories.Right} />
<Canvas of={DendrogramStories.Bottom} />
<Canvas of={DendrogramStories.Left} />

## Hang

Prop `hang` determines how the leaf nodes are attached to their branch.
The default is to draw all the leaves at the baseline.
Setting `hang` to a nonzero value instead positions the leaves a fixed distance from their branch.

## Scales

Props `scaleValue` and `scaleIndex` fine-tune the scales that capture the dendrogram hierarchy and the leaf elements,
respectively.
As in other views, these scales can be visualized with `Axis` components.

By default, leaf nodes are arranged in the order specified in the `data` object (field `ids`).
The node order can be adjusted by specifying a custom domain for the index scale.
