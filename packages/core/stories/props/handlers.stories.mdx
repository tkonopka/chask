# Handlers

Handlers are functions that perform actions in response to user interactions.
There are two types of handlers: those associated with individual components,
and those associated with data elements in batch.

## Handlers for individual components

Components such as `Rectangle` and `Path` create single visual elements on a chart.
They accept handlers for common mouse events: mouse enter, mouse move, mouse leave, and click.

Handlers for individual components receive an object summarizing the triggering event.
A custom implementation is as follows.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
const handleIndividualClick = (event) => {
  console.log('click')
}`}
/>

Such a custom handler can be provided to a component directly, for example:

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
<Rectangle x={0} y={0} width={10} height={10} onClick={handleIndividualClick} />
`}
/>

## Data-dependent handlers

Some components, especially in add-on packages, create several visual elements in batch.
(As an example, consider `Bars` from the `@chsk/band` package, which creates many rectangles to display a bar chart.)
Those components have a prop `handlers` that accepts a group of functions that mimic the handlers above, but
receive two inputs: a data object along with an object summarizing the triggering event.

<ArgsTable of={MockDataHandlers} />

An implementation of a custom handler would be as follows.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
const handleDataClick = (data, event) => {
  console.log('clicked ' + JSON.stringify(data))
}`}
/>

The content of the data object varies.
In the bar chart context, for example, it would contain an identifier and a value associated with the size of a bar.

Data-dependent handlers should be grouped and provided as a single prop `handlers`.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
<Bars handlers={{ onClick: handleDataClick }} />
`}
/>
