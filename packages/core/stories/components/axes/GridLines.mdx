# GridLines

<Meta of={GridLinesStories} />

`GridLines` draws a set of grid lines on a chart.

<ArgTypes of={GridLinesStories} />

## Variants

Prop `variant` determines whether grid lines are placed along the x- or y- axes.

<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.GridX} />
<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.GridY} />

## Line positions

Line positions can be set via prop `values`, which can be specified as a single value or as an array.
A single integer is interpreted as the approximate number of equally spaced grid lines along an axis.
An array is interpreted as the precise set of locations for the grid lines.

<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.CustomPositions} />

## Expansion

By default, grid lines run across the entire chart view.
It is possible to make them longer or shorter with prop `expansion`.

<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.LineExtent} />

## Styling

Grid lines can be styled using css.

<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.DashedGridLines} />
<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.NegativeLines} />

## Band scales

For band scales, grid lines appear at the center of each band by default.
It is possible to move the lines using prop `shift`, which takes an array of values.

<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.Band} />
<Canvas of={GridLinesStories.BetweenBands} />

Values in the `shift` array are interpreted as multiples of a base unit associated with the band scale.
The base unit is set with prop `shiftUnit`.
Unit `band` corresponds to the width of a bar on a bar chart.
Unit `step`, which is the default, corresponds to the width of a bar on a bar chart plus surrounding padding.
