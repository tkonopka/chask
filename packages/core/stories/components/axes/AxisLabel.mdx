# AxisLabel

<Meta of={AxisLabelStories} />

`AxisLabel` draws text intended as a label for an axis.
It is intended to be used a child of an `Axis` component.

<ArgTypes of={AxisLabelStories} />

## Variants

Variants creates labels configured for one of the top, right, bottom, or left axes.
For brevity, the examples below shows labels on the bottom and left axes.

<Canvas of={AxisLabelStories.BottomAxis} />
<Canvas of={AxisLabelStories.LeftAxis} />

Note that `AxisLabel` is meant to be used as a child in an `Axis` component, which itself carries a prop `variant`.
The `Axis` component automatically transfers the value of its prop `variant`
to its children components, including to `AxisLabel`. Thus, the prop can often be omitted in `AxisLabel`.
Alternatively, the prop can override the default value,
for example to create a top-axis label variant along a bottom axis.

<Canvas of={AxisLabelStories.TopLabelOnBottomAxis} />

## Distance from baseline

The distance between the axis line and the axis label is controlled by prop `distance`.
The value can be positive or negative, moving the label away or toward the center, respectively.

<Canvas of={AxisLabelStories.NegativeDistance} />

## Alignment

The position of the label along the axis is controlled by prop `align`, which
here takes a single value from 0 (start) to 1 (end).

<Canvas of={AxisLabelStories.Alignment} />

Note that the value of this prop is often adjusted together with the css style `textAnchor`,
as in the example above. Another prop to fine-tune the label position is `offset`, which
translates the label in an arbitrary direction.
