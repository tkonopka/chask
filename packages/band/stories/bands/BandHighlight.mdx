# BandHighlight

<Meta of={BandHighlightStories} />

`BandHighlight` draws masks on a band chart in response to the mouse pointer.

<ArgTypes of={BandHighlightStories} />

## Mouse motion

`BandHighlight` detect mouse movements and draws masks to highlight one band.
Hover the mouse on the charts below.

<Canvas of={BandHighlightStories.Vertical} />
<Canvas of={BandHighlightStories.Horizontal} />

## Interactivity

Prop `interactive` toggles interactivity.
Setting the prop to 'false' turns `BandHighlight` into a static decoration for selected ids.

<Canvas of={BandHighlightStories.Static} />

## Edge animation

By default, `BandHighlight` displays masks using a fade-in effect (cf. previous examples).
Flag `edgeAnimation` instead activates an animation that initially places masks at the edges of the band scale
and then spreads these masks to zoom onto a target.

<Canvas of={BandHighlightStories.EdgeAnimation} />

Note that the animation is only relevant when the mouse pointer first enters the chart.
