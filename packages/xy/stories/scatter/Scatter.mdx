# Scatter

<Meta of={ScatterStories} />

`Scatter` sets up a view for a scatter plot.

`Scatter` is an organizational component and it does not actually draw any visual elements.
However, it manages data representations that can be visualized with other components, for example `ScatterPoints` or `ScatterCurve`.

<ArgTypes of={ScatterStories} />

## Data

Data should be prepared as an array of objects.
All objects should contain an identifier `'id'` and an object called `data`.
The data associated with each identifier can be provided in one of two formats: a row-based or a column-based format.

The row-based format consists of an array or records, each of which will constitute a data point.
The pseudocode below provides an example.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "data": [
     {
       "a": 1,
       "b": 2,
       "c": 3
     },
     {
       "a": 2,
       "b": 4,
       "c": 6
     }
   ]
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

The alternative, column-based, format consists of a record with keys that provide arrays.
The pseudocode below provides an example.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "data": {
     "a": [1, 2],
     "b": [2, 4],
     "c": [3, 6]
   }
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

In both formats, keys 'a', 'b', 'c' provide access to values that can be mapped onto x- and y-axes.

## Accessors

Props `x` and `y` specify what values from the original data should be placed on the x- and y-axes.
These props can be strings that match keys in the data object, e.g. 'a', 'b', 'c' in the pseudo-code above.
Alternatively, (if the data is provided in the row-based format) the accessors can be functions
that compute numeric x- and y- values.

Prop `k` specifies another accessor that is used to associate each data point with a key/index.
In many use-cases, it is not necessary to specify this prop, and the relevant indexes will be provided automatically.
However, in use cases where `Scatter` is updated with different subsets of a large dataset,
specifying `k` explicitly can prevent unnecessary point animations across updates.

## Axis scaling

`Scatter` can set up x- and y-axes according to manual specifications, or determine relevant settings based on data.
In charts with automatic scales, prop `autoRescale` determines whether or not the scales re-adjust in response to chart state.
In the first example below (left), `autoRescale` is turned on.
Thus, the scales should update when data series are toggled through the legend.
In the second example (right), rescaling is turned off, and the scales should remain fixed after toggling the legend.

<Canvas of={ScatterStories.FixedScales} />

## Symbol size

By default, `Scatter` assumes all data points should have equal size.
The base size is determined by prop `valueSize`.

<Canvas of={ScatterStories.BaseSymbolSize} />

To apply different symbol sizes to each point, set `valueSize` to a string key that carries a size value in the original data.
Each point's size value is used together with the chart's size scale, specified with prop `scaleSize`.

<Canvas of={ScatterStories.BubbleSize} />

Note that size is interpreted as a quantity that is proportional to the area of a symbol.
To visualize the size scale, see `LegendSizeScale`.

## Symbol color

By default, symbol colors are determined automatically using a categorical color scheme.
Thus, colors are determined by the data series (see examples above).
The color scheme can be adjusted using prop `scaleColor` - use a categorical scale variant.

It is possible to apply colors to individual points by setting prop `valueColor`.
Values extracted with `valueColor` will be transformed into colors using a color scale specified via prop `scaleColor`.

<Canvas of={ScatterStories.BubbleColor} />

The data in the example above are the same as in the bubble size example.
Thus, large bubbles in the earlier examples appear as dark dots above.
To visualize the color scale, see `LegendColorScale`.

## Clipping

To restrict view content to the intended dimensions, use a `ViewClip` component.

The two examples below demonstrate the effects of clipping.
(Use the toolbar to zoom in and out.)
The first example does not use clipping, and the data points can appear beyond the axes upon zoom.
The second example uses clipping, and the data are always constrained.
