# HistogramBars

<Meta of={HistogramBarsStories} />

`HistogramBars` creates bars that represent histogram bins.

Note that `HistogramBars` provides similar output as `HistogramCurve` and `HistogramArea`.
However, whereas the other components paint a single object to represent the whole histogram, `HistogramBars` creates distinct rectangles.
This implementation makes it possible to visualize bin boundaries.

<ArgTypes of={HistogramBarsStories} />

## Styles

Prop `styles` applies css settings to the bars / rectangles.

<Canvas of={HistogramBarsStories.Default} />

## Css effects

Some interactivity can be achieved with css style classes defined in the chart theme.

<Canvas of={HistogramBarsStories.CssEffects} />

Above, the chart displays bars as well as two curves, and the bars change opacity when the mouse pointer hovers on the histogram.
Note that components that overlay the bars may require a css style `pointerEvents: 'none'`.

For another approach to provide interactivity, see the mouse event props, for example `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave`.
