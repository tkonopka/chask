`ViewClip` is an organizational component that restrict content to the bounds of a single view.

<ArgsTable of={ViewClip} />

`ViewClip` does not generate visible content.
However, it creates a clip mask and restricts all child elements to create content within that mask.
This can be useful for drawing views with bespoke scales, for example when using zoom operations.

For usage example, see the `Scatter` view in package `@chsk/xy`.
