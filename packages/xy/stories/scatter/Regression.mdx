# Regression

<Meta of={RegressionStories} />

`Regression` computes and draws regression lines on a scatter plot.

<ArgTypes of={RegressionStories} />

## Data subsets

`Regression` produces best-fit lines for all data series by default. It is also possible to restrict drawing to specific data series.

<Canvas of={RegressionStories.IndividualSeries} />

## Pooled data

By default, `Regression` treats individual data series. To produce a regression that combines several data series, set prop `variant` to 'pooled'. In the example below, toggle visibility of the data series and observe how the best-fit line changes.
