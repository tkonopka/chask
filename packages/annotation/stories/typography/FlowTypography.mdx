# FlowTypography

`FlowTypography` animates text so that it reveals one character at a time.

<ArgTypes of={FlowTypographyStories} />

## Reveal rate

The speed of text reveal is determined by props `rate` and `duration`.
Prop `rate` sets the number of characters that appear per second.
Prop `duration`, which overrides `rate`, sets the total length of time for the animation.

The two examples below display 'This is an example' using default settings (left)
and with custom `rate` to slow down the effect (right).
Click on the button to start the animation.

<Canvas of={FlowTypographyStories.Default} />
<Canvas of={FlowTypographyStories.SlowText} />

## Styling

Text can be styled using css, including with filters.

<Canvas of={FlowTypographyStories.Styled} />
