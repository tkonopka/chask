# HeatMapRectangle

<Meta of={HeatMapRectangleStories} />

`HeatMapRectangle` draws a single rectangle. This component is the default for drawing cells in `HeatMapCells`.

<ArgTypes of={HeatMapRectangle} />

Although `HeatMapRectangle` has a complex API, its implementation is actually rudimentary and ignores most of the props.
Notably, `HeatMapRectangle` does not support animations and always creates centered shapes.
These adjustments optimize the component for the heat map setting.

<Canvas of={HeatMapRectangleStories.Rectangles} />

(The complex API documents the props that `HeatMapCells` passes down to the cell component,
rather than the props that `HeatMapRectangle` uses. This should be documented differently at some point.)
