# Paragraph

`Paragraph` displays text and wraps long segments into multiple lines.

<ArgTypes of={ParagraphStories} />

## Position and alignment

Similarly to the `Typography` component, `Paragraph` accepts a prop `position` with absolute coordinates.
Unlike `Typography`, however, `Paragraph` also has a prop `align` that determines vertical alignment.

In the examples below, the `Paragraph` components are placed at the origin of the view (top-left corner).
The prop `align` determines whether it is the first line or another part of the paragraph
that aligns with `position`.

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.TopAlignment} />
<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.MiddleAlignment} />

To rotate the entire paragraph rotate around `position`, use prop `angle`.

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.Rotation} />

## Wrapping

`Paragraph` wraps long segments of text into multiple lines.
Prop `size` determines the recommended width of each line, and also the spacing between adjacent lines.

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.WrappingWide} />
<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.WrappingNarrow} />

`Paragraph` can accept a prop `separator` to split text at a specific text pattern.
Below, a separator is used to force an artificial line break after the first word.
Other line breaks are created as in the previous examples, i.e. based on the line size.

## Fonts and letter widths

Text wrapping is not automatic in SVG. Thus, the `Paragraph` component performs
calculations to determine where to break long text into separate lines.
The calculations estimate the width of words and try to fit as many words as possible on each line.

Prop `letterBaseWidths` can be set to either `sans` or `serif` to load letter profiles for a sans-serif font
(Arial) or a serif font (Times New Roman).
These profiles have been assembled manually based on letters of size 16px.
They only contain a small subset of characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and some punctuation).
The selection should cover many, although clearly not all, use cases.

To fine tune the line-break calculations, prop `letterWidths` accepts a dictionary mapping letters
to their widths in pixels. These props over-ride values in the `sans` and `serif` presets.
The custom values can be used to accommodate an unusual font or to support additional letters.

## Styling

Styles provided via prop `style` are applied to each line.

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.Centered} />

Note that css styles can affect the effective width of a text segment.
Such effects are not taken into account in the calculations that determine line breaks.

## Boxed labels

`Paragraph` components can be placed inside `BoxedLabel` components to create
the effect of a paragraph enclosed in a rectangle.

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.InBoxedLabel} />

Note that when placing `Paragraph` (or `Typography`) within a `BoxedLabel`, coordinates in prop `position` are relative to the center of the box.
