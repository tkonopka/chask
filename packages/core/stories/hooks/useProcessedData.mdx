# `useProcessedData`

The `useProcessedData` hook returns an object with a summary about a dataset.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
import { useProcessedData } from '@chsk/core'

// in a JSX component:
const { seriesIndexes, keys, data } = useProcessedData()
`} />

-   `seriesIndexes` will be an object/dictionary/map from string identifiers to integer indexes. This is intended to summarize the primary elements that appear in a chart, for example the content that will correspond to a group of bars on a bar chart.

-   `keys` will be an array of strings. This is intended to convey secondary elements, for example identifiers that will correspond to individual bars in a stacked bar chart.

-   `data` will hold a custom object, the structure of which will depend on the particular chart view.
