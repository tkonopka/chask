# Schedules

<Meta of={SchedulesStories} />

`Schedules` draws intervals on a schedule chart.

`Schedules` is intended to be used within a `Schedule` view. Note that while the `Schedules` component is the one that draws visual elements, much of the chart layout is determined by the parent view`Schedule`.

<ArgTypes of={SchedulesStories} />

## Data subsets

By default, `Schedules` draws the entire dataset. To draw subsets, set the props `ids` and `keys`.

<Canvas of={SchedulesStories.SelectedIds} />
<Canvas of={SchedulesStories.SelectedKeys} />

## Mouse events

To make elements respond to mouse events, set prop `handlers`.

<Canvas of={SchedulesStories.MouseClick} />
