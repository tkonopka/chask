# ScatterLabel

<Meta of={ScatterLabelStories} />

`ScatterLabel` draws a label on a scatter plot.

<ArgTypes of={ScatterLabelStories} />

## Position

The position of the label is determined by prop `position` and an accompanying `positionUnit`.
`ScatterLabel` uses the `position` to find a nearby data point, and then creates a label at that data point.

<Canvas of={ScatterLabelStories.Position} />

(The example above places the label so that its center overlaps with the data point.
In practice, the label can be adjusted away from the data point with props such as `anchor` and `offset`.)

## Variant

Prop `variant` modulates how the `position` is used to find a relevant data point.
The default variant 'xy' uses euclidean distance in two dimensions to find the nearest data point.
Variants 'x' and 'y' only consider the x- and y-coordinate, respectively.

The examples below show how the alternate variants can be used to align along the chart domain, or to find extrema.

<Canvas of={ScatterLabelStories.Y} />

## Rotation

The label can be rotated with prop `angle`.
Alternatively, a prop `autoRotate` can find a relevant rotation angle.
This calculation relies on nearby points and is suited for line charts.
