# chsk

Chsk is a library of React components for data visualization.
It provides a toolkit for creating static charts for offline publications,
dynamic components for dashboards, and animated stories for presentations.

## Features

The library provides React components for data visualization.

-   **Core components** include axes, legends, tooltips, typography elements,
    and geometric shapes.
-   **Data-specific components** include bar charts, line charts,
    scatter plots, density maps, pie/doughnut charts, strip charts,
    quantile/box plots, violin plots, histograms, heat maps, set (Venn)
    diagrams, upset diagrams, and schedule (Gantt) charts.

Advanced features enable creating dynamic and bespoke content.

-   **Milestone animations** power step-by-step story-telling.
-   **Rich interactions** allow data exploration through zooming, panning, and dragging.
-   **Customizable components** combine in arbitrary ways to compose truly
    original designs.
-   **Annotation components** add decorations to base charts.
-   **Hooks** provide access to chart state and enable the implementation of custom components.
-   **Export utilities** save charts into optimised svg files.
