# BoxedLabel

`BoxedLabel` displays a text label enclosed in a rectangle.

<ArgTypes of={BoxedLabelStories} />

`BoxedLabel` is closely related to `BoxedTitle`, but it offers more control of positioning.

## Position

The prop `position` marks a location on the chart / view.
This is specified as a pair of `[x, y]` values.
The values can be specified as absolute svg coordinates, or as fractions of the view dimensions.
In the latter case, the prop `units` should be set to `'relative'`.

## Anchors

Prop `anchor` determines what part of the label is aligned with the point on the chart designated by `position`.

<Canvas of={BoxedLabelStories.AnchorTopRightCorner} />

## Offset

Prop `offset` accepts an array `[x, y]`, which shifts the position of the label.
The translation can be used, for example, to displace a label from the center or a corner.

## Rotation

The label can be rotated using prop `angle`.
