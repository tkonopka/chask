# Counter

<Meta of={CounterStories} />

`Counter` creates a text element displaying a number.

<ArgTypes of={CounterStories} />

## Position

`Counter` shares many props with `Typography`. The position of the text, for example, is determined by prop `position`.

<Canvas of={CounterStories.Position} />

## Format

By default, `Counter` displays a number 'as-is'.
Prop `nDecimalPlaces` introduces rounding to a fixed number of decimal places.
Alternatively, prop `format` accepts a function to perform custom number-to-string conversion.
This can be used, for example, to display values as percentages.

Format functions can also introduce styling with `tspan` elements.

<Canvas of={CounterStories.CustomFormatTspan} />

If a format function is insufficient, it is also possible to render the counter with a custom component.
The default component is `Label`, but this can substituted with prop `component`.

## Transitions

`Counter` has two distinct transition props.
The first prop, `transition`, affects animations of the component's position.
The second, `valueTransition`, controls changes of the displayed number.
In the example below, the value update is set up to take a fixed amoung of time - three seconds.
