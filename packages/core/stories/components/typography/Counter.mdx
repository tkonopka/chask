# Counter

<Meta of={CounterStories} />

`Counter` creates a text element with a number. Its characteristic feature is that when data changes, the number is animated.

<ArgTypes of={CounterStories} />

## Position

`Counter` shares many props with `Typography`. The position of the text, for example, is determined by prop `position`.

## Content format

By default, `Counter` displays a number 'as-is'.
Prop `nDecimalPlaces` introduces number-rounding to a fixed number of decimal places.
Alternatively, prop `format` accepts a function to perform custom number-to-string conversion.
This can be used, for example, to display values as percentages.

## Custom components

For even more control over how the counter is displayed, prop `component` accepts a custom React component.
Custom components can be used to, for example, display text with nested `tspan` tags.

<Canvas of={CounterStories.CustomComponent} />
