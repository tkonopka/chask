# DataComponent

<Meta of={DataComponentStories} />

`DataComponent` is a wrapper function that associates event handlers with other components.

`DataComponent` binds event handlers to chart components so that the actions triggered by those events depend on object-specific data.
It is used extensively by add-on packages to provide interactivity for chart components.

## Event handlers

`DataComponent` can be used to handle events on multiple components with a single handler function.

Event handlers should be prepared as functions that accept two arguments: a data object and a mouse event object.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  const customOnClick = (data, event) => {
  ...
  }
  `}
/>

In the example below, a single `customOnClick` function is associated with two different components (circles).

<Canvas of={DataComponentStories.ClickEvents} />

(Click on a circle, then check the browser console with `Ctrl Shift J` for output.)

## Style modifiers

## Custom implementations

One use for `DataComponent` is to implement custom changes to element colors and styles.

In add-on packages, e.g. `@chsk/xy` and `@chsk/band`, some chart components are assigned
fill and stroke colors automatically. These colors override settings in the chart theme.
In particular, it is not possible to use `:hover` styles in the chart theme to toggle these
colors upon mouse events. Instead, such tuning can be made in custom implementations
of `DataComponent`.

The example below changes the circle stroke color in response to mouse events.
Hover the mouse pointer and click on the circles, and observe changes to the outlines.

<Canvas of={DataComponentStories.CustomImplementation} />

The above example uses a custom function `CustomDataComponent` that is a stand-in for `DataComponent`.
