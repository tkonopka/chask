# Violins

<Meta of={ViolinsStories} />

`Violins` draws shapes to summarize distributions on a violin chart.

`Violins` is intended to be used within a `Violin` view.
Note that while `Violins` draws the distributions, much of the chart layout is determined by the parent view `Violin`.

<ArgTypes of={ViolinsStories} />

## Variants

Prop `variant` toggles smoothing.
The default variant, `smooth`, creates the classic 'violin' shapes.
Variant `step` instead creates step-wise histograms.

<Canvas of={ViolinsStories.Smooth} />
<Canvas of={ViolinsStories.Step} />

## Data subsets

By default, `Violins` draws the entire dataset. To draw subsets, set props `ids` and `keys`.

<Canvas of={ViolinsStories.SelectedIds} />
<Canvas of={ViolinsStories.SelectedKeys} />

## Styling

Violins can be styled with css.
In particular, note that attribute `fillOpacity` may be needed to trigger a solid fill (see above).
