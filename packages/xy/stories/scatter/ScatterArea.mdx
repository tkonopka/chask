# ScatterArea

<Meta of={ScatterAreaStories} />

`ScatterArea` draws a polygon bounded by a series and a constant baseline.

<ArgTypes of={ScatterAreaStories} />

## Baseline

The prop `baseline` determines the vertical extent of the curve

<Canvas of={ScatterAreaStories.DefaultBaseline} />
<Canvas of={ScatterAreaStories.CustomBaseline} />

## Layering

The `ScatterArea` component is often used together with `ScatterCurve`.

<Canvas of={ScatterAreaStories.Composite} />

## Css effects

Some visual interactivity can be achieved with css style classes, applied via the chart theme.

<Canvas of={ScatterAreaStories.CssEffects} />

This technique applies to all components, but can be particularly visible with component with large surface area.

For another approach to provide interactivity, see the mouse event props, for example `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave`.
