# Bar

<Meta of={BarStories} />

`Bar` sets up a view for a bar chart. `Bar` itself does not draw any visible elements, but it pre-processes a dataset so that the data can be visualized by other components, for example `Bars`.

<ArgTypes of={BarStories} />

## Data

Data should be prepared as an array of objects. All objects should contain a string identifier `'id'`. Other keys with numeric values can be used to display bars.

The pseudocode below shows one data item with an identifier and three numeric values.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "x": 55,
   "y": 35,
   "z": 10
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

## Variants

Prop \`variant' specifies whether the bar chart should be organized with groups of bars displayed side-by-side, or stacked one after the other.

<Canvas of={BarStories.VerticalGrouped} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.VerticalStacked} />

## Orientation

Prop `horizontal` determines the orientation of the bars.

<Canvas of={BarStories.HorizontalGrouped} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.HorizontalStacked} />

## Band padding

The specification of the band axis through prop `scaleIndex` controls the spacing between the edges and the bars (`paddingOuter`) and between groups of bars (`paddingInner`).

<Canvas of={BarStories.LargeOuterPadding} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.LargeInnerPadding} />

## Internal padding

For grouped bars, an additional padding prop `paddingInternal` controls the space between bars within one group.

<Canvas of={BarStories.LargeInternalPadding} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.ZeroInternalPadding} />

## Keys

The prop `keys` determines the number of subgroups that are incorporated into the chart.
Below, both examples use a grouped bar layout based on the same data as above.
The second chart uses a single key, and thus displays a simple bar chart.

<Canvas of={BarStories.TwoKeys} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.SingleKey} />

## Custom spacing

By default, bars are arranged with equal spacing along the axis.
It is possible to customize the spacing through the specification of the band scale, with prop `scaleIndex`.
Below, the examples use a dataset with seven bars, and the second example applies extra padding before one of the bands.

<Canvas of={BarStories.EqualSpacing} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.CustomSpacing} />

## Missing data items

Datasets may have missing/omitted values.
For example, the dataset below has three data series with different keys.
Key 'x' is present for series 'alpha' but it is not present for series 'beta'.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "x": 85
  },
  {
   "id": "beta",
   "y": 45
  },
  {
   "id": "gamma",
   "z": 60
  }
  ]
  `}
/>

Bars that would correspond to id-key combinations with missing values are omitted.
This behavior can be used to draw a 'stacked' chart that appears like a regular bar chart, but where bars appear with different colors (below, left).
Another way to achieve the same result is to set prop `variant` to 'layered'.
This variant arranges all elements associated with one id on top of each other (below, right).

<Canvas of={BarStories.MissingKeys} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.NullInternalPadding} />

## Axis Scaling

Scales on the axes can be set manually, or determined automatically based on the data.

When the scale on the value axis is set to automatic, it will automatically rescale/adjust when the data changes or when certain keys are toggled using a legend (below, left).
The automatic rescaling can be disabled using prop `autoRescale` (below, right).

<Canvas of={BarStories.AutoRescaling} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.FixedScales} />

## Negative values

The `Bar` component can accept negative values.
Note, however, for data that contain both positive and negative values for an index, bars may appear overlapping.
