# Bar

<Meta of={BarStories} />

`Bar` sets up a view for a bar chart. `Bar` itself does not draw any visible elements, but it pre-processes a dataset so that the data can be visualized by other components, for example `Bars`.

<ArgTypes of={BarStories} />

## Data

Data should be prepared as an array of objects. All objects should contain a string identifier `'id'`. Other keys with numeric values can be used to display bars.

The pseudocode below shows one data item with an identifier and three numeric values.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "x": 55,
   "y": 35,
   "z": 10
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

## Variants

Prop `variant` specifies whether the bar chart should be organized with groups of bars displayed side-by-side or stacked one after the other.

<Canvas of={BarStories.VerticalGrouped} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.VerticalStacked} />

## Orientation

Prop `horizontal` determines the orientation of the bars.

<Canvas of={BarStories.HorizontalGrouped} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.HorizontalStacked} />

## Band padding

The specification of the band axis through prop `scaleIndex` controls the spacing between the edges and the bars (`paddingOuter`) and between groups of bars (`paddingInner`).

<Canvas of={BarStories.LargeOuterPadding} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.LargeInnerPadding} />

For grouped bars, an additional padding prop `paddingInternal` controls the space between bars within one group.

<Canvas of={BarStories.LargeInternalPadding} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.ZeroInternalPadding} />

## Keys

The prop `keys` determines the number of subgroups that are incorporated into the chart.
Below, both examples use a grouped bar layout based on the same data as above, but displaying different keys.
The second chart uses a single key and thus displays a simple bar chart.

<Canvas of={BarStories.TwoKeys} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.SingleKey} />

## Custom scales

Configurations for the axes are set with props `valueScale` and `indexScale`.
These scales must define the scale `variant`, which are typically set to `linear` and `band`, respectively.

By default, both value and the index scales adapt their domain to suit the dataset.
The example below shows a dataset with seven bars.

<Canvas of={BarStories.EqualSpacing} />

Both the value and index scale accept custom domain.
For the value axis, this can be used to enforce the visibility of fixed upper/lower bounds.
For the scale axis, custom domains can be used to reorder ids.

<Canvas of={BarStories.FixedValueScale} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.ReorderedIds} />

By default, bars are arranged with equal spacing along the index axis.
It is possible to customize the spacing by adding extra spacing at specified locations.
Below, extra spacing before one of the bands creates a visual separation into two groups.

<Canvas of={BarStories.CustomSpacing} />

## Continuous index scales

Typically, the index scale is a categorical/band scale with a domain consisting of discrete elements/stings.
However, it is also possible to use a continuous scale, for example, a linear scale or a time scale.

In the pseudocode below, ids are strings that encode numeric values.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "1",
   "x": 4
  },
  {
   "id": "2",
   "y": 7
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

The chart below uses a linear scale to map the ids onto positions along the horizontal axis.

<Canvas of={BarStories.LinearIndexScale} />

To achieve this effect, it is necessary to set `scaleIndex` to the appropriate variant and to
define the scale domain. It is also necessary to define the width associated with a band.
This is set via `bandwidth`, which accepts an array of two values.
The interval between those values determines the width of the bands.
The reason the bandwidth is specified as a pair of values and not a single number is to
accommodate nonlinear scales (e.g. logarithmic scales).

## Missing data items

Datasets may have missing/omitted values.
For example, the dataset below has three data series with different keys.
Key 'x' is present for series 'alpha' but it is not present for series 'beta'.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "x": 85
  },
  {
   "id": "beta",
   "y": 45
  },
  {
   "id": "gamma",
   "z": 60
  }
  ]
  `}
/>

Bars that would correspond to id-key combinations with missing values are omitted.
This behavior can be used to draw a 'stacked' chart that appears like a regular bar chart, but where bars appear with different colors (below, left).
Another way to achieve the same result is to set prop `variant` to 'layered'.
This variant arranges all elements associated with one id on top of each other (below, right).

<Canvas of={BarStories.MissingKeys} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.NullInternalPadding} />

(To repeat, the two charts above use two different methods to produce the same effect.)

## Automatic Scaling

Prop `autoRescale` toggles automatic rescaling of the value axis in response to chart state (via the legend).
By default, axes automatically rescale/adjust when the data changes or when keys are toggled using a legend.

<Canvas of={BarStories.AutoRescaling} />
<Canvas of={BarStories.FixedScales} />

## Negative values

The `Bar` component can accept negative values.
Note, however, for data that contain both positive and negative values for an index, bars may appear overlapping.
