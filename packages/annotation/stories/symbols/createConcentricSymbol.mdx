# createConcentricSymbol

`createConcentricSymbol` is a factory.
It creates a function that creates a symbol composed of two concentric parts.
It can be used to create composite symbols such as concentric circles, squares, or any other shapes.

<ArgTypes of={CreateConcentricSymbolStories} />

**Note:** `createConcentricSymbol` is a factory method and creates new functions.
An example usage is as follows.

<Source
  language="javascript"
  code={`
  import { createConcentricSymbol } from '@chsk/annotation'

const ConcentricCirclesBg = createConcentricSymbol({ variant: 'background', rMultiplier: 1.4 })
`}
/>

The examples below demonstrate behavior of components creates with this pattern.

## Variant

A concentric symbol is composed of one primary symbol and one secondary symbol.
Prop `variant` determines whether the secondary object appears in the background or in the foreground.

`variant` is often used together with prop `rMultiplier`,
which determines the size of the secondary object relative to the size of the primary symbol.

<Canvas of={CreateConcentricSymbolStories.Foreground} />

## Symbols

The shapes of the primary and secondary parts are controlled with props `symbolPrimary` and `symbolSecondary`.

<Canvas of={CreateConcentricSymbolStories.Hybrid} />
