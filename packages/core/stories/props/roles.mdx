# Roles

The `role` attribute is used in svg to ascribe semantic meaning to elements whose purpose would
otherwise be unclear. Most library components carry a prop `setRole` that toggles the appearance
of role information in the svg code.

<ArgTypes of={MockSetRole} />

`setRole` is a boolean flag.
For most components, its value is set to `true` so that the svg source code includes some semantic information.
This information can be eliminated by toggling the flag.

<Source
    language="jsx"
    code={`
// source JSX code

<Typography variant={'title'} setRole={true}>
    First title
</Typography>
<Typography variant={'sub-title'} setRole={false}>
    Second title
</Typography>

// resulting SVG code

<text role="title" class="title">
    First title
</text>
<text class="subTitle">Second title</text>
`} />

Note that for typography components, the role attribute is borderline redundant:
the same information is also automatically incorporated into the class name.
However, for higher-level components, the role attribute can be quite information.
It helps with accessibility, including during manual inspections in svg files and in the console.
