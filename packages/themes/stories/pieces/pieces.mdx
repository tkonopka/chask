# Theme pieces

Theme pieces, like partial themes, are objects that satisfy typescript type `ThemeSpec` from `@chsk/core`.
Unlike partial themes, theme pieces have more targeted effects and only modify the appearance of a small number of elements.

## `buttonTheme`

`buttonTheme` holds definitions for `text`, `rect`, and `path` associated with css class 'button'.

This theme piece is used in the gallery charts to style buttons that trigger downloads.

<Story of={PiecesStories.Button} />

## `tooltipItemLabelValue`

`tooltipItemLabelValue` holds definitions for `text` components with css classes `tooltipItem label` and `tooltipItem value`.

This theme piece is useful in quantile charts, which display tables with key-value pairs.

<Story of={PiecesStories.TooltipItemLabelAndValue} />
