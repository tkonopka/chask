# Modifiers

Modifiers are style definitions that augment a base style.
They can be used to adjust visual appearance in response to mouse events.

<ArgTypes of={MockModifiers} />

Modifier styles should be grouped into one objects. As an example, consider the following object.

<Source
    language="jsx"
    code={`
const customModifiers = {
  onMouseEnter: { stroke: '#000000' },
  onMouseClick: { strokeWidth: 2 },
  onMouseLeave: { }
}`}
/>

When creating a bars in a bar chart with `Bars`, this object can be provided to prop `modifiers`.

<Source
    language="jsx"
    code={`
<Bars modifiers={customModifiers} />
`}
/>

As a result, bars in the chart should adjust their appearance in response to mouse events.

Note that style modifications are not animated by the chsk framework.
However, styles may contain [css animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation).
