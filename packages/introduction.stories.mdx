# chsk

Chsk is a library of React components for data visualization. It provides a toolkit for
creating static charts for offline publications, dynamic components for
dashboards, and animated stories for presentations.

## Features

The library provides React components for data visualization.

-   **Core components** include axes, legends, tooltips, typography elements,
    and geometric shapes.
-   **Data-specific components** include bar charts, line charts,
    scatter plots, pie/doughnut charts, strip charts, quantile/box plots,
    histograms, heat maps, set/Venn diagrams, upset diagrams, and schedule/Gant charts.

Advanced features enable creating dynamic and bespoke content.

-   **Milestone animations** power step-by-step story-telling.
-   **Zoom and pan interactions** allow in-depth data exploration.
-   **Customizable components** combine in arbitrary ways to compose truly
    original designs.
-   **Annotation components** add decorations to base charts.
-   **Hooks** provide access to chart state and enable the implementation of custom components.
-   **Export utilities** save charts into optimised svg files.
