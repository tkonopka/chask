# Components

Some higher-order components (in add-on packages) create several related elements.
An example is `Bars` from the `@chsk/band` package, which typically creates several `Rectangle` shapes at once.
To allow customization, the higher-order components may include props with prefix 'component'.

<ArgTypes of={MockComponent} />

Prop `component` specifies a function used to create the individual elements.
In the bar chart example, this would be set to `Rectangle` by default.

`componentProps` accepts an object whose contents will be passed down to the `component` function.
This allows over-riding default settings in the `component` function.

An important use case for `componentProps` is specifying custom transitions and animation states.
This may involve setting `transition`, `initial`, and/or `animate` fields.
Some of the possibilities are showcased in gallery examples.

Note that higher-order components set some props for the `component` function.
Some of the props in `componentProps` thus may end up being discarded.
For example, `Bars` sets `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` for each shape in a bar chart,
so custom values for those variables in `componentProps` will not have any effect.
The exact behavior will depend on the higher-order component.
