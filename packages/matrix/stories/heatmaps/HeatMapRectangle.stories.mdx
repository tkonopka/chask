# HeatMapRectangle

<Meta title="Addons/Matrix/HeatMaps/HeatMapRectangle" />
export const Template = args => <HeatMapCells {...args} />

`HeatMapRectangle` draws a single rectangle. This component is the default for drawing cells in `HeatMapCells`.

<ArgsTable of={HeatMapRectangle} />

Although `HeatMapRectangle` has a complex API, its implementation is actually rudimentary and ignores most of the props.
Notably, `HeatMapRectangle` does not support animations and always creates centered shapes.
These adjustments optimize the component for the heat map setting.

(The complex API documents the props that `HeatMapCells` passes down to the cell component,
rather than the props that `HeatMapRectangle` uses. This should be documented differently at some point.)
