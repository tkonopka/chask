# chsk

Chsk is a data visualization library for React. It provides a toolkit for
creating static charts for offline publications, dynamic components for
dashboards, and animated stories for presentations.

## Features

The library provides React components for data visualization:

-   **Core components** include geometric shapes, text labels, axes,
    legends, and tooltips.
-   **Data-specific components** include bar charts, line charts,
    scatter plots, pie/doughnut charts, strip charts, quantile/box plots,
    histograms, heat maps, set/Venn diagrams, upset diagrams, and schedule/Gant charts.

Some features worth highlighting:

-   **Milestone animations** enable step-by-step story-telling.
-   **Low-level components** combine in arbitrary ways to compose truly
    original visualizations.
-   **Annotation components** add bespoke decorations to base charts.
-   **Hooks** provide access to chart state and enable the implementation of
    arbitrary custom components.
-   **Svg utilities** save charts into small, optimised svg files.

## Examples
