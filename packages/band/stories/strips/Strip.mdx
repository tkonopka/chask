# Strip

<Meta of={StripStories} />

`Strip` sets up a view for a strip chart.
`Strip` itself does not draw any visible elements, but it pre-processes a dataset so that the data can be visualized by other components, for example `Strips`.

<ArgTypes of={StripStories} />

## Data

Data should be prepared as an array of objects.
All objects should contain a string identifier `'id'`. Other keys with numeric values can be used to display distributions.

The pseudocode below shows one data item with an identifier and two numeric arrays.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
  [
  {
   "id": "alpha",
   "x": [1, 2, 3, ,...],
   "y": [2, 4, 6, ...],
  },
  ...
  ]
  `}
/>

## Jitter

Prop `jitter` determines how data elements are arranged within a single strip.
The default behavior places the elements in the order in which they appear in the dataset.
It is also possible to explicitly randomize / shuffle the order, or to sort the elements in ascending or descending order.

<Canvas of={StripStories.None} />
<Canvas of={StripStories.Random} />
<Canvas of={StripStories.Ascending} />
<Canvas of={StripStories.Descending} />
<Canvas of={StripStories.Middle} />

Note that the data points in the dataset are randomized from the start.
The default and newly-randomized arrangements (first two examples above) thus produce layouts that are quite similar in this case.

## Orientation

Prop `horizontal` arranges the strips in the horizontal direction.

<Canvas of={StripStories.Vertical} />
<Canvas of={StripStories.Horizontal} />

## Other features

`Strip` supports many of the same features as `Bar`, for example, for adjusting padding.
See the documentation for `Bar` for examples.
